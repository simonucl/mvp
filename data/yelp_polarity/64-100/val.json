He then started to interrogate me as to why I did not bring it up when we were there.  I explained that we were excited about being there, extremely hungry due to our 45 min wait, and then being satisfied at the end.  In not so many words, he basically accused me of lying about it.  REALLY?!!!! I would seriously call that night and then the next day to lie about not getting our appetizer.

{"label":1,"sentence":"The wife and I started with the blooming onion.  The breading had a lot of flavor and the dipping sauce was very good, but the whole thing was very greasy. \\n\\nNext we had the French onion soup and 2 salads.  The soup was average.  The salads were great though. I had the wedge salad.  The bleu cheese dressing and the balsamic vinaigrette complemented each other very well.  One of the best wedge salads I have had.  The wife ordered the classic bleu salad, with bleu cheese vin, candied pecans, wonton strips, very good. \\n\\nFor entrees, my wife ordered the wood fire grilled filet with mushroom Madeira sauce and a baked potato. Her filet was undercooked, but the sauce made up for it.  I ordered the alice springs chicken with a baked sweet potato.  The sweet potato was great, loved the butter and the brown sugar.  Same with the chicken.  I didn't know pouring honey mustard dressing over it would actually enhance the flavor. \\n\\nOverall better meal than I was expecting."}
{"label":1,"sentence":"Frost is a great gelato shop that has a lot of unique and interesting flavors.  Sometimes, it's hard to pick just one or two, but I usually make up my mind pretty quickly.\\n\\nTheir best selling flavor is Seasalt Caramel and I have to admit it is one of my go-to flavors when I'm having a tough time deciding.  One of my personal favorites is their Dark Chocolate.  It's pretty thick and is almost like eating a cold brownie, but I think it's delicious and get it almost every time we go.\\n\\nOne of my only complaints about Frost is, as soon as you go through the line and get up to the counter, the employees ask what they can get for you right away without giving you a chance to look in the case to see what flavors they have.  I know that theer is a menu on the wall, but they do have seasonal flavors that are not listed on the menu and I usually need a few moments to browse the case to see what strikes me that day.\\n\\nThe other thing about their menu is that it is not always accurate.  As I write this review, I am looking at their menu online and see that they have Butter Pecan listed as a flavor but on one visit when I tried to order Butter Pecan they told me it was a seasonal flavor and they did not have it available.  This can be concerning since I cannot trust that the flavors on the menu are the flavors in the case.\\n\\nThey only have four indoor tables and during the busy times this are usually packed but there are a few tables outside and while it's not 117 degrees out, they are a nice place to sit.\\n\\nFrost also has some great no-sugar added flavors which is nice.  I usually end up going to Frost with my wife and 18 month old so (who loves bananas) so its nice to be able to get him a no-sugar added banana gelato and not feel like I'm filling him up with terrible things that he shouldn't be eating.\\n\\nOverall, Frost is a great place and we love going there.  When you go, tell the staff that you need a minute to look at the falvors they have and they will give you the time you need.  Frost is also open later than most of the other stores in the San Tan mall (10pm during the week and 11pm on the weekends), so it's nice to have a late-night place to hit before the day is done."}

{"label":1,"sentence":"The hubby and I were searching for a new restaurant to try out for a quick lunch and we ended up at Cajun Yard Dog.  The place is a little small but quaint.  The ambiance was relaxed and casual with a seat yourself approach at the front door.  The menu offered plenty of tasty cajun options including the standard jumbalaya and po' boy sandwiches.  I enjoyed the fact that they had a long list of classic southern sides to choose from on the menu (however corn bread, one of my favorites at cajun restaurants, is not included in this list).  I ordered the pimento grilled cheese sandwich with a side of collard greens.  My meal was delicious.  The pimento cheese had quite a kick to it and my nose was running by the end of the meal.  My husband ordered the seafood jumbalaya.  He's long been in search for the best jumbalaya in Charlotte and has ordered it at several restaurants only to be disappointed.  He actually seemed to enjoy it at this restaurant even though it was served with mussels which is usually outside of his seafood range.  \\nThe service was decent despite the fact that only one waitress was serving the entire restaurant by herself.

{"label":1,"sentence":"Let me start by saying that I am always skeptical about going to a \\\"\"new\\\"\" club because you never really know what to expect. Vanity exceeded my expectations on every level!\\n\\nWe went last Sunday night (on Easter). Sundays are the day to be at Vanity for sure! We always do our best to be on guest list to avoid waiting and try to arrive early enough to get in & get drunk before it gets too crowded. That having been said, we got to Vanity around 10:45 (since most clubs open around 10 or 10:30 pm), but we forgot that Vanity is the rare exception to the rule - They do not open till 11 pm. When we got there, there were only a few other people standing by the ropes. There was no real line, you just have to fight your way to the front and talk to someone at the door. When they started letting people in, we were let in almost immediately, and since we were on guest list, ladies were free, and I think guys paid $10. Not to shabby. \\n\\nOnce we got in to the club, we went right up to the bar and got served right away. Drinks were good, and average priced for Vegas ($7-9 for a beer, $12-15 for a mixed drink). Although this club is smaller than most, it didn't seem to be over crowded, and it was relatively easy to get served at all of the bars pretty quickly. \\n\\nThe chandelier over the dance floor is absolutely breath taking! I could have stood there and stared at it all night! The DJ played terrific music all night long, and they even had a drummer that came and played a few sets along with the DJ... Never saw anything like this before, but I'm hooked! The whole crowd was jumping around and singing along - couldn't have asked for a better time!\\n\\nThe workers here are HOT HOT HOT! Of course, being at the Hard Rock, the go go dancers have a little edge to them, and it was kind of cool to see.

They are so attentive, and it makes your experience here that much better.\\n\\nAnd of course, I have to write about the women's bathroom, which is the known highlight to this club. They have everything you can imagine at your disposal, and they even have workers that will help you fix your hair & make up!

I look at the frozen fish and wonder how in the world to prepare such things. I look at the sake aisle and wish I knew which to pick, which one wouldn't soil my taste buds. Sometimes I'm tempted to pick up their fresh slices of sashimi, but I usually pass. I just can't talk myself into it. \\n\\nI walk by the fresh fish, past the butchers and men with their imploring eyes. I feel uncomfortable under their gaze. I can only imagine what they're thinking. That's when I pretend even harder - pretend that I know what I'm doing, instead of wandering the aisles looking at anything from poxy stix to soy sauce. \\n\\nThen I end up in the meat section, dumbstruck. Gizzards. Tongue. Heart. It's like a lab here, animals dissected to entertain my morbid fascination. I tend to get repulsed when I get to the chicken feet. \\n\\nSo, I pass through the produce aisle and stutter near the bakery. Here is where I once picked up the most delicious bread I've ever had.

I keep hoping, though, that someday we will be re-united -- myself and that delectable bread - otherwise known as \\\"\"crack in a bag.\\\"\"  \\n\\nSo, if I'm so uncomfortable, why do I even bother? Because I like trying new things, from teas to bread to meat. I just can't seem to pick up the latter, for fear of self-poisoning. Plus, nothing beats cheap bags of edamame here. Other stores want nearly $4 for a bag. Screw that. \\n\\nI've also tried their milk pearl tea here. It's not bad. It's not something I'd get very often, for I can find better concoctions elsewhere.

{"label":1,"sentence":"This is probably one of the best local restaurants in Las Vegas. Everything is excellent: the food, the drinks, the service, the decor, the ambiance...it really doesn't get any better than this, for a local spot. As an avid foodie, I was very impressed. We went there with a party of four people, for an early dinner seating. We were greeted nicely and were seated immediately. As for the decor, it is a nice mix of modern with hints of rustic. I wouldn't necessarily call this place eclectic, but it's somewhere along those lines. The industrial feel of the ceiling is a great touch. \\n\\nWe shared two appetizers that were mentioned as specials by our server who, by the way, was exceedingly attentive and knew the entire menu by heart - but not in a \\\"\"this is what I'm supposed to tell you\\\"\" kind of way. One appetizer consisted of a few shrimp, drenched in a garlicky, lemony sauce, with generous portions of chorizo sausage. They are served alongside buttered bread, making them excellent vessels for leftover sauce. They were absolutely delicious. We also shared the BBQ ribs, which were also delicious and perfectly cooked. They fell right off the bone, and thankfully did not taste overly smokey (no moist towlettes necessary either). The ribs come with a side of grilled pineapple, which perfectly complemented the meat portion. Overall, we were quite impressed by our choice of appetizers.  \\n\\nAs for our entrees, we decided to share four plates: jerk lamp chops, chicken curry, slow cooked pork, and braised short ribs. Without a shadow of a doubt, they were all amazing, and it was hard to decide which was the best. We could have done without the lamb chops, as you can basically get those anywhere, yet the ones they serve at DW do have a hint of delicious jerk seasoning, but were somewhat overcooked. They are served over roasted, seasonal vegetables. The slow-cooked pork is served in a bowl, atop white rice. The sauce is very spicy (though you can tell your server how you feel about spices), and tasted similar to a Mexican \\\"\"pibil\\\"\" sauce (made with achiote paste), or a Mexican mole. We couldnt' really identify the ingredients used, but they tasted delicious! As for the short ribs, these were also excellent...perfectly cooked in a melt-in-your-mouth manner. They are served alongside one of the best mashed potatoes I have ever tasted in Las Vegas. Lastly, we shared the chicken curry, which is served in a large bowl. It tasted nothing like Indian or Thai curry, but had a distinct, garlicky sauce that was to die for....perfectly seasoned, and perfectly cooked. I thought the string beans added the perfect amount of crunch as well. And, the curry is served over cous cous, which absorbs the creaminess of the curry and is really quite amazing. \\n\\nWe couldn't decide on a dessert, so we went for the dessert sampler. Little did we know that we would be served full-sized portions of different dessert items. There were three cakes: red velvet (delicious, with white chocolate shavings on the cream cheese frosting), chocolate mousse cake (very chocolatey and, surprisingly, not very heavy), and Jamaican carrot cake (it was probably my favorite of the three). Also, there were hand-rolled chocolate truffles...delicious. And, a lemon pudding that was refreshing and velvety. We couldn't finish it all. \\n\\nFor drinks, we tried their version of Mojitos, which were made with fresh lime juice, muddled mint, and strawberries. We only had one each, as we felt that if we were to go for a second, we would immediately feel a buzz. \\n\\nWe loved this place, and cannot wait to go back soon, especially for their brunch service on Saturdays and Sundays. The only negative thing I have to say is that they were out of their DW chorizo and saffron rice, which I would imagine is to die for. I'll have to go back and hope they have it then. We each ate for around $50, including drinks and tip. And finally, I have to say that I love the location of the restaurant...it's in a nice, quiet neighborhood that seems very lively and happening at night."}
