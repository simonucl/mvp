I will stay out of this discussion Yelp is not the time nor place for that, nor can I say that indeed this is the issue affecting my food. \\n\\nFirst, It was not extra spicy at all. Im not scared of the heat, and I expressly said this when ordering. I was told that it isnt a problem that lots of people order extra spicy, and it would be just that. \\n\\nSecond, it just did not seem like there were extra veggies. We order this way because we split and it gives both of us a good amount of everything. \\n\\nThird, the rice was very dry, and tasted old to me.\\n\\nFourth, practically every table in the place was covered in dirty dishes. EW! Maybe there was a staffing issue. At least attempt to clear the tables so folks can sit down and eat. Kinda important!\\n\\nReview time!\\n\\nCurbage: -5 (virtually every table was dirty, and we should have gone across the street to Chipotle. This shows the quality of service this day)\\n\\nP factor: 7 (needed minor attention, no checklist today)\\n\\nOrder waiting time: 9 (very busy but our order was taken quickly)\\n\\nAmbieance:2 or 3 (hard to want to eat an anticipated meal when the entire patio and dining room tables are covered in dirty dishes)\\n\\nFood arrival time: 9 (for as busy as it ws our food arrived fairly quickly. I noticed the runners were trying to bus tables also. I believe normally this is not the case here. I will say that this practice is very disgusting and should NEVER be practiced. Do you want your meal brought to you by someone who just bussed another dirty table without washing thier hands before touching your plate. i know i dont.)\\n\\nFood taste: 8 (even though the rice was very dry and there seemed to be not enough veggies, and it just was not spicy, the flavor was good)\\n\\nOverall: 5 \\n\\nToday i am on the fence.

Yeah, that pool noodle really failed to perform, give me my 2.99 back.  And they act like they are doing you a favor at that.  These sharks have gotten their last dollar out of me.  They are not there to help you, they are there to line their pockets with you.  I guess if you need something and you know what you need and you can get in and out without buying anything extra they might be ok, but don't trust their advice.

For a second I thought I was in a sushi restaurant but a beef tartare hand roll makes for a scrumptious appetizer.  \\n\\nTomato Tartlet\\nI'm guessing that this is the name of the dish as this was the only tomato anything I saw on the menu.  We ordered this dish since it seemed like every table around us had ordered it.  I love me some tomatoes and this dish was refreshingly tasty.  The pesto in the olive oil combined with what I'm guessing to be crumbled mascarpone was a perfect complement in this dish.\\n\\nClams\\nThis has got to be the best clam dish I've had.  Perfectly steamed in the most delicious creamy sauce that had a slight taste of parmesan. I'm salivating just thinking about it. \\n\\nDuck in a can \\nThe presentation is quite fun to watch.  While all the components of this dish are prepared well, the first few bites were great and then it became savory overload for me.  But that's just my taste, my boyfriend quite enjoyed the dish overall. \\n\\nFoie Gras Poutine\\nMy favorite of the evening.  I love poutine!  I only wish I could find some in socal.  APDC had the best gravy for their poutine that I've ever had. And the foie gras was like morsels of special yumminess in each bite. \\n\\nPoached Pear with Vanilla Ice Cream\\nWhen this dessert was delivered to our table, we thought, wow - that really IS a poached pear.  But it was the most refreshing dessert that I've ever had.  The vanilla ice cream was a perfect complement to the pear which was fresh and juicy.  \\n\\nOverall, I would definitely come to APDC again the next time I go to Montreal.  Hopefully with a larger party so that we could sample more of the menu. I'm sure there is much more fatty, porky, duck related goodness that I've still yet to discover."}

{"label":1,"sentence":"I went to this location and the one in Henderson, all I have to say is soft, moist and the frosting is totally on point. Softest cupcake\/cake I've ever tasted. This place will have you craving for more, I'm kinda OK with not having one close to me, cause that would be my drug of choice. who ever reads a negative review about the flavor and taste at a Nothing Bundt Cake, something is wrong with person's taste buds and brain function... Oh and the price is good to, just wait till you see how big the individual packaged product is."}
{"label":1,"sentence":"This review was a bit late but we went here a few months ago for my friends Birthday and it was great. Between the apps, meals and desserts we were all happy. I don't remember what everyone ordered but I remember sharing the calamari dish and the cheese,meat and veggie chef  board and they were great we could not get enough. For my entree I ordered the the Riccota Gnocchi with braised short ribs, the Gnocchi was perfectly cooked and the braised short ribs melted in your mouth. A lot of us shared our entrees with others and I got to try the bolognese with fresh pasta and there is nothing like eating fresh pasta, I also tried the fig and  prosciutto  pie and that was awesome (besides the goat cheese I do not like goat cheese. Don't judge me). I ended my night with the Bombolini , I also shared these with others and loved them along with tasting the salted caramel budino. next time I go back I am set on getting the bolognese and the Salted caramel budino. I def suggest going here the service was on point also."}

{"label":1,"sentence":"The Phoenix Public Market Caf\\u00e9 is a definite \\\"\"must visit\\\"\" for lunch if you find yourself in the Downtown Phoenix area. I've already visited 3 times within the past month and each time I was not disappointed. The Market Caf\\u00e9 is located off of Central on Pierce in a recently renovated space that once housed the Phoenix Public Market grocery store. But instead of talking about the history, let's talk about my experience at the Market Caf\\u00e9. \\n\\nDuring my first visit, I did a quick overview of their menu and ordered the AZ Burger just to play it safe. The AZ Burger came with green chile, lettuce, cheddar, and their house dressing. The burger was cooked well and the bread that holds all the goodness together is great. I was not disappointed with the burger or the service during my first visit. \\n\\nFor my second visit, I decided to try something else and ordered the grilled cheese which is served on toasted multi-grain bread with sharp cheddar cheese. You're probably reading this and thinking that I could have made the same thing at home. You're right! However, what makes this grilled cheese awesome is the bread. Even though the bread is toasted, it remained a little soft and warm in the middle while the crust had a nice toast to it. In addition to the sandwich, I ordered a side of fries that also didn't disappoint. They were lightly salted and still a tad soft when they were plated and served. My second visit was a success. \\n\\nCan the Phoenix Public Market Caf\\u00e9 go three for three? You bet they can! I went back for a third visit and ordered the fries again but this time I ordered the chicken salad sandwich which is served with basil, pine nuts, arugula, and tomatoes all found between two slices of 9-grain bread. This sandwich packs some amazing flavor and some texture thanks to the bread they used. Whomever the Market Caf\\u00e9 is using as their baker, they should do everything in their power not to lose him\/her. \\n\\nTo date, my experiences at the Market Caf\\u00e9 have been positive thanks to the great food and service. Aaron Chamberlin has done an amazing job with the space and also brought a wonderful yet simple menu to the Downtown Phoenix area. By the way, If you have specific dietary needs (i.e. vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, dairy free), then this is a place you can visit and find something that suits your needs as well. \\n\\nIf you are a supporter of local and enjoy good food, be sure to visit the Market Caf\\u00e9 at the Phoenix Public Market."}

{"label":1,"sentence":"I don't review companies very often, but I felt so well taken care of by TRS that I wanted to give them a big 5 STAR rating here on Yelp to let people know that they are the hands down BEST mold remediation company I've ever done business with. \\n\\nI had a big job that needed addressing. Mold was found in several areas in a 4200 sf home I was selling last month (I'm a Realtor). We were in escrow already and so needed fast action on bids and work done. Todd was absolutely wonderful. He was courteous and friendly, extremely knowledgeable - I felt he was honest and upstanding 100% - and I've been in the RE business for 10 year so I've seen my fair share of contractors, good and bad. Todd stayed in excellent communication with me and his bid beat others by a good margin. The work completed was confirmed by professional testing, and I, the buyer's agent, the buyer and seller were all very happy with the work done. \\n\\nI actually found this company on Yelp via other great ratings, and I am happy to report that Todd's services and professionalism exceeded my expectations. I gave his info to my broker to hold on to as a reference for all the agents in my brokerage needing a fair and reliable mold remediation company. I recommend TRS all day long - he handled this big job for me beautifully and I know he'll do a great job on any job he's called on, big or small. It's tough to find a company out there as excellent and upstanding as TRS. Exceptional customer service, job well done, great price. TRS is first-rate all the way."}
{"label":1,"sentence":"I got to go float with my wife and daughter as a birthday present. My original gift was going to be a pedicure and I am glad I got this instead. We checked the company out online and got to see what floating was all about. We went there and were greeted by Brittany; she was very helpful and went over all the benefits that we would get from floating. We all went into our rooms took our showers and and got cleaned off. I got into my pod and closed the lid and it was amazing that I could float and relax right away. I turned off the light and then the music came on. I float myself in total relax mode and drifting off to sleep. I find that if you use the neck pillow you will be better off. Once I was near the end of my float; I starter stretching in the water and I got out showered off and sat in the lounge and could find myself drifting off in the chair. I drank about 4 glasses of water afterwards. All in all I would recommend this to anyone that has some pain, or high stress in their life. True Rest is a definite winner"}
