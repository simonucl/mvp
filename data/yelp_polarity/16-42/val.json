It was the usual\\n\\nThai Dynamite extra sauce,extra spicy, extra veggies w\/brown rice.\\n\\nHere were the problems, and it seems it may be worse since the run in with the sherriff on the whole worker thing. I will stay out of this discussion Yelp is not the time nor place for that, nor can I say that indeed this is the issue affecting my food. \\n\\nFirst, It was not extra spicy at all. Im not scared of the heat, and I expressly said this when ordering. I was told that it isnt a problem that lots of people order extra spicy, and it would be just that. \\n\\nSecond, it just did not seem like there were extra veggies. We order this way because we split and it gives both of us a good amount of everything. \\n\\nThird, the rice was very dry, and tasted old to me.\\n\\nFourth, practically every table in the place was covered in dirty dishes. EW! Maybe there was a staffing issue. At least attempt to clear the tables so folks can sit down and eat. Kinda important!\\n\\nReview time!\\n\\nCurbage: -5 (virtually every table was dirty, and we should have gone across the street to Chipotle. This shows the quality of service this day)\\n\\nP factor: 7 (needed minor attention, no checklist today)\\n\\nOrder waiting time: 9 (very busy but our order was taken quickly)\\n\\nAmbieance:2 or 3 (hard to want to eat an anticipated meal when the entire patio and dining room tables are covered in dirty dishes)\\n\\nFood arrival time: 9 (for as busy as it ws our food arrived fairly quickly. I noticed the runners were trying to bus tables also. I believe normally this is not the case here. I will say that this practice is very disgusting and should NEVER be practiced. Do you want your meal brought to you by someone who just bussed another dirty table without washing thier hands before touching your plate. i know i dont.)\\n\\nFood taste: 8 (even though the rice was very dry and there seemed to be not enough veggies, and it just was not spicy, the flavor was good)\\n\\nOverall: 5 \\n\\nToday i am on the fence.

Week after week I go into these stores and have one problem after another.  My pool is never right.  It is never swimmable and they keep selling me more and more and more chemicals.

I finally decided for the money I was spending I could just hire someone.  Sure enough, for $140 the professional fixed everything and for $70 they include the chemicals and do the work.  All Leslie's wants to do is sell you stuff and they will sell you all kinds of extra stuff to keep you coming in.  I should have just hired someone to begin with but Leslie's kept telling me the next thing would be my magic fix.  There is nothing they have to sell there but heartache, and worse yet, they offer no guarantee on anything, they SAY in the big letters 14 day guarantee, but then the fine print excludes chemicals.  Yeah, that pool noodle really failed to perform, give me my 2.99 back.  And they act like they are doing you a favor at that.  These sharks have gotten their last dollar out of me.  They are not there to help you, they are there to line their pockets with you.  I guess if you need something and you know what you need and you can get in and out without buying anything extra they might be ok, but don't trust their advice.  I spent over 7 months with an unswimmable pool and have thrown several thousand dollars worth of chemicals into it, all from Leslie's.

My mouth was watering when the waiter opened the lid.  The prime rib looked so yummy and juicy.  However both the burger and prime rib were disappointing.  Both lacked major flavor.  Too bland.  We also had a side of creamed spinach.  Again, lacked flavor and basic salt.  The only thing I enjoyed was the split pea soup.  That was really good and hearty.  Service was standard.

I am not a huge fan of Las Vegas. I generally do not go to Vegas unless I really have to. There are too many lights, smoke and opportunities to blow my bank my account.\\nVdara is perfect because:\\n\\n- ALL rooms are non-smoking. As a matter of fact, the entire facility is non-smoking. I was down at the bar when some guy tried to light up a cigar. Unanimously, several of the patrons and bar staff looked at him in horror. We all told him the place was non-smoking and he'd have to take a little walk to the Aria to light up. Sorry smokers, this is one place in Vegas where you're going to have to let the rest of us breathe in peace.\\n\\n- The suites are all very roomy and definitely private. My suite had a kitchenette, dining area, living area, sleeping area and HUGE bath room. I had a free suite upgrade (no $20 sandwich trick), so I'm guessing I got one of the larger suites. I had a great view of the Bellagio fountain show and loved the automated curtains (esp. the Blackout option).\\n\\n- Besides the bar and small caf\\u00e9 in the lobby, there isn't a casino, so there isn't a lot of noise or a crowd around that's going to cause a huge ruckus.

I would say this is a 3 star hotel, BUT given the fact that it's nearly always the best value on the strip, it's a 4 star.\\n\\nThe pool complex is good.  There is a pool for kids and one for 18 and up.  Also, you can get a cabana for a day for about 80$ during the week or off season.  The price fluxuates but it's always worth asking.  Can you beat that in Vegas?  The pool used to let you bring in an outside drink if you put in a plastic cup, but on a recent trip this was not the case.  I may or may not have purchased a half yard margarita, drank it, and re-filled it in the room to bring back to the pool, though.\\n\\nThe excalibur is great for the budget minded.  There is a baja fresh, with solid meals for under 10$.  Also walk by Dick's Last Resort and they'll usually hand you a coupon for a free jello shot.  Not bad.\\n\\nThe location isn't the best, but there is some good stuff nearby.  New York New York is right next door.  The Luxor, MGM, and Mandalay Bay are also nearby.  It's about a 45 minute walk to center strip.\\n\\nWhile there are a lot of families with young kids that stay there, Excalibur somehow strikes a good balance.  There are kids around, but they hardly if ever bother me.  Nothing like a Circus Circus type place.

{"label":1,"sentence":"Anthony Bourdain referred to Au Pied De Cochon as a temple to all things fatty, porky, and duck related.  I would also like to add oh-so-yummy.  This was our first meal in Montreal and there couldn't have been a better place start to a lovely trip. \\n\\nI booked reservations a few weeks in advance which seemed to be a smart move as the restaurant was packed non-stop throughout the evening. The restaurant itself is cozy and the simple decor reminded me a lot of Avec in Chicago.  I also love that APDC maintains a fairly casual atmosphere.  There is nothing better than eating delicious food at a restaurant that doesn't take itself too seriously, even if the food is seriously great.  A major factor which attributes to APDC earning a 5 star rating is their service. Everybody, from the hostess to our waiter to the various running staff here, were so delightfully pleasant and so attentive.  I immediately felt an affinity towards the awesomeness of my fellow Canadians.\\n\\nOn to the eats:\\n\\nBeef Tartare\\nI really liked the presentation on APDC's beef tartare. For a second I thought I was in a sushi restaurant but a beef tartare hand roll makes for a scrumptious appetizer.  \\n\\nTomato Tartlet\\nI'm guessing that this is the name of the dish as this was the only tomato anything I saw on the menu.  We ordered this dish since it seemed like every table around us had ordered it.  I love me some tomatoes and this dish was refreshingly tasty.  The pesto in the olive oil combined with what I'm guessing to be crumbled mascarpone was a perfect complement in this dish.\\n\\nClams\\nThis has got to be the best clam dish I've had.  Perfectly steamed in the most delicious creamy sauce that had a slight taste of parmesan. I'm salivating just thinking about it. \\n\\nDuck in a can \\nThe presentation is quite fun to watch.  While all the components of this dish are prepared well, the first few bites were great and then it became savory overload for me.  But that's just my taste, my boyfriend quite enjoyed the dish overall. \\n\\nFoie Gras Poutine\\nMy favorite of the evening.  I love poutine!  I only wish I could find some in socal.  APDC had the best gravy for their poutine that I've ever had. And the foie gras was like morsels of special yumminess in each bite. \\n\\nPoached Pear with Vanilla Ice Cream\\nWhen this dessert was delivered to our table, we thought, wow - that really IS a poached pear.  But it was the most refreshing dessert that I've ever had.  The vanilla ice cream was a perfect complement to the pear which was fresh and juicy.  \\n\\nOverall, I would definitely come to APDC again the next time I go to Montreal.  Hopefully with a larger party so that we could sample more of the menu. I'm sure there is much more fatty, porky, duck related goodness that I've still yet to discover."}
