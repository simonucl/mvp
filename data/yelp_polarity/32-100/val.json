I knew I wanted to try a new place, so I decided to check out Augusta dental. The woman hygienist I had was wonderful. I will definitely be returning. I've since returned and love it. I feel like the staff actually care and everyone is so great at what they do and welcoming. Dr. O is great"}
{"label":1,"sentence":"truly a meat-lover's paradise... okay, they have stuff for non-red meat eaters and even veggies, too.  two Angus burgers (with blue cheese and swiss respectively), skinny fries, fat fries (which are not steak fries) and two pints were quite tasty.  I was dying to try the Rossini but didn't... the $50 I saved was better spent elsewhere.  Sports lovers should sit at one of the booths -- you can watch the game du jour in slack-jawed silence while you eat!  Yeah, it's kind of expensive for a burger, but sadly, it's a good deal for palatable food in a Vegas where cheap AND tasty food no longer seems to exist."}
{"label":1,"sentence":"I really like this place.  This is a great place to have lunch or happy hour drinks.  It's located at the Scottsdale Quarter right next to a very nice iPic movie theater, so it's convenient for pre\/post movie cocktails as well.\\n\\nLunch is my favorite time to come.  The Prosciutto di Parma Ciabatta and the Turkey Panini are two of my favorite dishes.  They're both only $10 ea and comes with Parmesan Fries, which are addicting...yum!\\n\\nThe lunch crowd here is relatively light for Scottsdale, which means you'll get in\/out pretty fast.  Service here is always very good.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 90%"}
{"label":1,"sentence":"Great breakfast food. Got the Snooze Spuds (a plate of hashbrowns and cheese with your choice of add-ins) and the daily Banana Fosters pancake on the side. I didn't realize the pancake would be so HUGE! But everything was really good and the service was great. Go with a hearty appetite if you want to try more than one thing."}
{"label":1,"sentence":"This is hands-down my favorite place in Pittsburgh. I have never ever had a bad meal here and I've probably come here once a week for maybe 10 years. \\n\\nTop favorites are:\\n\\n- Fish and chips, smothered in tartar and malt vinegar for those hangover or self-indulgent days\\n- Chicken and Wild Mushroom pie for cold and rainy days\\n- Veggie Boxty and a Bloody Mary for those silly days\\n- English breakfast for chores days \\n- Veggie sandwich with chipotle mayo and coleslaw for those days I'm trying to be healthy. \\n- Salmon salad for business lunches\\n\\nI love it so much that I have a meal selection for every possible situation!"}
{"label":1,"sentence":"This place is an oriental cafe, taiwanese restaurant and a juice bar. They do fresh fruit juices, fruit smoothies, coffee, tea, \\\"\"bubble coffee\\\"\" and \\\"\"bubble tea\\\"\" (very nice!) and great Asian food. You can enjoy anything from chicken chow mein to tom yum soups and more. Especially good are their dim sum and sui mei buns. \\n\\nI find the menu great, the food flavoursome and yes, the service is a bit slow, but if you are in a rush tell them you're on your lunch hour and they will speed it up for you. \\n\\nI usually go on a Sunday afternoon and don't mind waiting for my order as I love the place so much.  The only downside I find is that it's never open on a Saturday, which is my treat day (but obviously his too as he's always closed for \\\"\"family day\\\"\")."}

{"label":1,"sentence":"The wife and I started with the blooming onion.  The breading had a lot of flavor and the dipping sauce was very good, but the whole thing was very greasy. \\n\\nNext we had the French onion soup and 2 salads.  The soup was average.  The salads were great though. I had the wedge salad.  The bleu cheese dressing and the balsamic vinaigrette complemented each other very well.  One of the best wedge salads I have had.  The wife ordered the classic bleu salad, with bleu cheese vin, candied pecans, wonton strips, very good. \\n\\nFor entrees, my wife ordered the wood fire grilled filet with mushroom Madeira sauce and a baked potato. Her filet was undercooked, but the sauce made up for it.  I ordered the alice springs chicken with a baked sweet potato.  The sweet potato was great, loved the butter and the brown sugar.  Same with the chicken.  I didn't know pouring honey mustard dressing over it would actually enhance the flavor. \\n\\nOverall better meal than I was expecting."}
{"label":1,"sentence":"Frost is a great gelato shop that has a lot of unique and interesting flavors.  Sometimes, it's hard to pick just one or two, but I usually make up my mind pretty quickly.\\n\\nTheir best selling flavor is Seasalt Caramel and I have to admit it is one of my go-to flavors when I'm having a tough time deciding.  One of my personal favorites is their Dark Chocolate.  It's pretty thick and is almost like eating a cold brownie, but I think it's delicious and get it almost every time we go.\\n\\nOne of my only complaints about Frost is, as soon as you go through the line and get up to the counter, the employees ask what they can get for you right away without giving you a chance to look in the case to see what flavors they have.  I know that theer is a menu on the wall, but they do have seasonal flavors that are not listed on the menu and I usually need a few moments to browse the case to see what strikes me that day.\\n\\nThe other thing about their menu is that it is not always accurate.  As I write this review, I am looking at their menu online and see that they have Butter Pecan listed as a flavor but on one visit when I tried to order Butter Pecan they told me it was a seasonal flavor and they did not have it available.  This can be concerning since I cannot trust that the flavors on the menu are the flavors in the case.\\n\\nThey only have four indoor tables and during the busy times this are usually packed but there are a few tables outside and while it's not 117 degrees out, they are a nice place to sit.\\n\\nFrost also has some great no-sugar added flavors which is nice.  I usually end up going to Frost with my wife and 18 month old so (who loves bananas) so its nice to be able to get him a no-sugar added banana gelato and not feel like I'm filling him up with terrible things that he shouldn't be eating.\\n\\nOverall, Frost is a great place and we love going there.  When you go, tell the staff that you need a minute to look at the falvors they have and they will give you the time you need.  Frost is also open later than most of the other stores in the San Tan mall (10pm during the week and 11pm on the weekends), so it's nice to have a late-night place to hit before the day is done."}

{"label":1,"sentence":"Lighting system is pretty sick. The club is not very upscale as far as the decor goes but who cares, we had a pretty good time and will definitely be back next time we are in vegas."}
{"label":1,"sentence":"Love! Super awesome place to grab a quick meal and it's not super heavy or unhealthy like other places. Got the salmon salad and it was great for the price! Usually salmon dishes are at least $12+. All salads also come with a crostini and lots of different options for everyone. I will definitely be back."}

{"label":1,"sentence":"After paying a little too much for valet parking, my second favourite ginger and I (I put myself first), messily dragged our weekend bags behind us through the revolving doors into this hotel. \\n\\nHello, Gorgeous! \\n\\nHuge white marble arches, columns and gold touches decorated to the nines for Christmas. This might sound gaudy, but this place is all class. Fancy like Reba circa 1992. Divine like Bette Midler circa always. \\n\\nThe rooms are beautiful with all the extras you would expect, including starchy white robes, movies and 24 hour room service. We didn't have much of a view, but who cares, we had a king size bed and a bubble bath. \\n\\nPEPPER POINTS to hotwire.com for getting us a cheap deal at this glorious abode. It'd a bit too rich for my blood without the deal."}
{"label":1,"sentence":"The hubby and I were searching for a new restaurant to try out for a quick lunch and we ended up at Cajun Yard Dog.  The place is a little small but quaint.  The ambiance was relaxed and casual with a seat yourself approach at the front door.  The menu offered plenty of tasty cajun options including the standard jumbalaya and po' boy sandwiches.  I enjoyed the fact that they had a long list of classic southern sides to choose from on the menu (however corn bread, one of my favorites at cajun restaurants, is not included in this list).  I ordered the pimento grilled cheese sandwich with a side of collard greens.  My meal was delicious.  The pimento cheese had quite a kick to it and my nose was running by the end of the meal.  My husband ordered the seafood jumbalaya.  He's long been in search for the best jumbalaya in Charlotte and has ordered it at several restaurants only to be disappointed.  He actually seemed to enjoy it at this restaurant even though it was served with mussels which is usually outside of his seafood range.  \\nThe service was decent despite the fact that only one waitress was serving the entire restaurant by herself.  I liked that I was able to get a to-go cup for my tea when we were leaving.  It made up for the fact that they didn't offer splenda in their repertoire of sweeteners on the table."}
{"label":1,"sentence":"Everyone told us we had to go here so we tried it. The place was packed but the service was pretty good. The smell of grease was pretty strong so we decided to eat outside.\\nThe burgers were very tasty and the French fries were great.\\nLeast expensive meal we had all week."}
