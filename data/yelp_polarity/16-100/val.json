{"label":0,"sentence":"First time in Vegas and we totally had to hit a buffet because that's what you DO in Las Vegas! \\n\\nArrived at Planet Hollywood, wandered aimlessly through the mall, through the smokey casino and down the escalator where we were met with wonderful smells and a horrendous line that consumed a good hour and a half of our time. \\n\\nWas it worth the wait? Was it worth the $106 charge for three people? \\n\\n... Eh.\\n\\nThe prime rib, while divine, was cut thin enough I could see through it. But the flavor notes of just about everything else made up for it... Aside from the cupcakes. The icing, on many of them, is straight up whipped butter and lacking any other flavor aside from \\\"\"Heart attack\\\"\". \\n\\nThe wait staff seemed disgruntled and when my friend asked for another glass of water, the waitress picked up my husband's yet to be sipped from glass and handed it to her. Talk about lazy and nasty!"}

Not the place to go if you've come out for a night of chat and banter with randoms.\\n\\nI might not be old Edinburgh money, but I can certainly choose where to spend mine and I don't think this place would see any of my hard earned pennies again."}

{"label":0,"sentence":"I'd rate this a 2.5 if it was available.  The restaurant is thoroughly mediocre in my opinion.  They have a fairly boring and standard line up of barbecue, burgers and sandwiches.   The prices are fairly decent compared to many barbecue places but the sauce and cooking is pretty average.  The sides are nothing exciting and some of them (coleslaw) I won't order again. Nothing about this restaurant stands out to me as something to look forward to when it comes up on the lunch rotation.\\nThe all you can eat buffet seems like a waste unless you are trying to add to your waist.  You can get plenty to eat for a couple of bucks less by ordering off the menu and the days when they have the buffet, its a madhouse trying to get seated.   The parking is also terrible."}

To top it off, the staff is unfriendly and even at times disdaining."}

When the cops came to talk to us, they were joking and laughing it up with us. They thought it was a waste of time also.

{"label":0,"sentence":"SO DISAPPOINTED!  I had been a regular at this restaurant because of the delicious food and the servers.  I went back today after a couple months away to find that they have changed owners, changed personnel, and CHANGED THEIR FOOD!  First of all, the took the professional looking menus and changed them into printed ones with spelling mistakes.  Then, they raised the prices.  The food was not as flavorful and did not have the same taste.  They got rid of my favorite mustard sauce and replaced it with shrimp sauce...not nearly as good.  Service was S..L..O..W..I almost got up and left.  The server was nice enough, but new and didn't know much..I didn't see any of the servers that used to be there.  The only plus is that they now have happy hour until 10pm throughout the restaurant...\\nFor the cost and the raised prices, I can definitely do better.  And that makes me sad."}

They went out of their way to describe the history and intricacies of each work of art.  It made even the most average of pieces come alive.\\n\\nThe car collection was amazing, and the staff in the outbuilding were equally helpful.  The gentleman that I spoke with went through the collection car by car, giving an enormous amount of detail and history for each vehicle.

The facility is pleasant, immaculate and huge - and available to students for practice at any time, not just during their lessons.\\nAs mentioned in a previous review, they have a great deal for first time students.

Also, the view is best experienced from the observation deck (which is free from the lounge).  The strip is pretty far away so my pics from the Eiffel Tower were better, but the overall experience at Level 107 was more fun.
