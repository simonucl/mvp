{"label":1,"sentence":"[MY BACKGROUND]: I've been coming to Vegas since 1994, and tried pretty much every buffet on the Vegas strip. \\n\\n[DATE VISITED]: Saturday, March 16th, 2013, Dinner Buffet. Entered the line at 5:10PM, paid at 6:00PM, started eating at 6:40PM. \\n\\n[THE INTERIOR]: Before you enter the buffet, you will see a huge line, that will remind you of Disneyland. Once you enter the buffet, its major chaos..Chaos!! There are way too many people, and most of the tables seemed very close together. The noise level is really loud. I definitely will not bring my older relatives here, as they might find it too hectic. It seems like the people at Caesar's had a very obscure shaped room to fit in a buffet of this size. \\n\\n[THE FOOD]: Besides long lines, and chaotic atmosphere, the food here is really really good. The Asian section is probably one of the most authentic tasting Asian section at any Las Vegas buffet. This also goes for the rest of the buffet. The cocktail shrimps they serve are also one of the largest sized cocktail shrimp of any Vegas buffet I've tried.  My sister and I stood in line for the steamed crabs for at least 20 minutes. Determined that we were not going to wait in this line again, we practically filled mountain high 2 plates each (4 plates total), with a layer of cocktail shrimp, and a  huge pile of king crabs on top (we had 4 plates of these). Needless to say, we were a little carried away with how much we brought for my family of 4, but I think we pretty much were satisfied with how much shrimp and crab we ate, that it justified the $50 dinner cost. Also their dessert section is amazing. They also have different flavored mochi and gelato.\\n\\n[THE SERVICE]: Our server was amazing, in terms of getting our drinks, and cleaning our finished plates. No complaints at all here.  \\n\\n[THE GOOD]: \\n- some of the best tasting buffet food hands down\\n- the selection and variety is amazing, \\n- the presentation of the foods in the small plates is very nice\\n\\n[THE BAD]\\n- long Lines to get into the buffet, \\n- more lines in the buffet to get the food\\n- chaotic atmosphere\\n- noise level is high, definitely not a place for a romantic dinner\\n- One design flaw of the buffet is the line for the steamed crabs. The people that stood in line for the steamed crabs blocked off the whole seafood section. So for the people that did not want steamed crabs, but lets say want a piece of salmon in the seafood section, you couldn't because the people in line for the steamed crabs stood right in front of the food. I guess you could try to sneak in between people in the steamed crab line to get some food, but everybody in line for the steamed crabs had the \\\"\"I'm waiting in line, you should too\\\"\" face.  This design flaw also applies to the meat carving section. The line for the meat carving section blocked off another section of the buffet, hence other people couldn't get to those foods either. At one point the line for the steamed crabs and meat carving section blended together, to form one mega line, that caused a lot of confusion. The issue is, they steam the crabs a little at a time, so the line went really really sloowwww. The line wasn't moving at multiple points. We waited at least 20 minutes to get the steamed crabs. They really should place a line divider for the people in these lines so they don't block half of the buffet. \\n\\n[OVERALL EXPERIENCE]: I've always wanted to try the Bacchanal buffet ever since it opened. We asked the waiter if its always like this, but they said its less crowded on the weekdays, and at earlier times. If I go again next time, I'm going to go at 3:30 PM, and try to avoid the 6 PM dinner crowd."}
