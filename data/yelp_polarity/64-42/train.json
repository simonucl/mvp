The servers were confused about who was going to get our table, so it would have been a long time before we could have ordered our entrees if we didn't go back to the bar. My friend ordered tacos, which she had one and took the rest home since she was full on the appetizer and so much time passed between courses. I ordered the pollo margarita which was a little dry, but good. The potato thing was nasty.

They also have plenty of comfy chairs and couches, which for me, is KEY to a good used bookstore. And the people running the place really were quite friendly and chatty."}

{"label":1,"sentence":"We just love  this restaurant, even though there is another shabu-shabu restaurant closer to us.  The Wife usually orders the \\\"\"shabu-shabu style\\\"\"  seaweed based broth, while I always order the \\\"\"sukiyaki style\\\"\" soy sauce based broth.  Both are mild in flavor.  The broth is placed in a stainless steel bowl on top of an induction cooker in front of you.  They have also creatively crafted a bowl shaped in a yin and yang, so that two people can enjoy both broths at the same time.  What a great idea!\\nYou select the type of meat, poultry or seafood you desire.  I get either beef, pork or a mixture of both.  The Wife usually orders the raw sea scallops.  We found out that the scallops are sushi grade and not the tiny ones.  Forget cooking them in the broth, we just eat these neatly sliced and scrumptious raw scallops after dipping them straight into a mixture of soy sauce and wasabi.  \\nAnother great thing about this place, is that the vegetables are unlimited.  Also, the salad is so tasty.  It's has this awesome dressing that is mayo-based, tangy, and has a slight sweet finish.  I usually end up ordering at least 2-3 salads because of that damn dressing.  \\nThe main reason why I love this place is all about those tofu noodles.  This was where I had this type of noodle for the first time.  I always go insane and ask for heaps of it.  It's unlimited!!!  It's all about the texture of these noodles.  This noodle is perfect for shabu-shabu because no matter how long you leave it in the boiling hot broth, the noodle it's texture.  It does not get mushy.  It's so hard to describe its texture because it's slippery and soft but has a slight crunch to it.  It's like eating jellyfish in a jellyfish salad.  It's out of this world for my mouth!!!!  (i mean the noodles....hmmm maybe also the jellyfish salad, but i love both)  \\nBecause of the mild flavor of the broths, after cooking each piece meat, vegetable, and tofu noodles, you are able to flavorize them by dipping them in either a peanut based, a ponzu, or a spicy ponzu sauce.  I love the spicy ponzu sauce because it has a good amount of heat and is just so tangy.  \\nI highly recommend this place.  The service has always been excellent and the flavors and quality of food has been so consistent for the number of times we have gone there.  I can't wait to go back there again!!!"}

{"label":1,"sentence":"Well after eating so many times at this place I decided to finally write a review.\\n\\nThe good: I usually go to this Robertos for a late night snack, trough the drive thru  and order the Carne Asada Fries,  more bang for your buck, with taxes it comes out to $8.63. Now i'm a picky eater so I only get the fries, Carne Asada, and the cheese.  It  always taste great and the people working the drive trough are always courteous. \\n\\nThe bad: The only thing i periodically dislike is that I don't think they have a set standard of how much stuff they put on your plate\/container. Usually I'll get lucky and get great amounts of Carne Asada, Cheese and Fries. A couple of times though the guy making them (it's always a guy) gives me good amounts of beef but will skimp out on the fries and the Cheese. I llike my cheese! lol. \\n\\nThe ugly: I think the owner is hella (west coast slang there) cheap. Since we started visiting this Robertos, the drive true speaker has been broken. You usually can't understand the person taking the order, and many times the person taking the order has told us to drive directly to the window were you pay to take our order. I think I've visited 15 times this year, and it still hasn't been fixed.  Also I dislike the whole \\\"\" pay one extra dollar to use a debit\/credit card\\\"\" their website says they have 65 locations total, I think they can go without that extra \\\"\"one dollar fee\/surcharge\\\"\" \\n\\nI would have given the \\\"\"taco shop\\\"\" a five if it wasn't for the chepness and the irregularity of the carne asada to cheese to fries ratio. The taste of the food and the service does give them a solid 4 in my book. I still recommend this place."}
{"label":1,"sentence":"I found this place via groupon and will definitely be back. I took my wife for some drinks and laughs and this place delivered both well.

Loud!! in the evening."}
{"label":1,"sentence":"Tiny restaurants seem to be the new (not so) big thing in Edinburgh these days. This place is so tiny you have to squeeze through the kitchen to get to the loo. So maybe not the best choice if you have any OCD hygiene issues.\\n\\nThe menu is short and simple. They just do a few things, and from what we tasted, they do them extremely well. The soft spring rolls were gorgeous, and the pho had that delectable deceptively simple flavour that gets more complex with each mouthful. Really delicious and fragrant.\\n\\nThey don't serve booze but you can BYOB for \\u00a31 per bottle. But it's not really the sort of place to linger over a bottle of wine. Get in, get fed, get out. \\n\\nI agree with Joe that it would be great if they moved somewhere bigger so they could expand the menu accordingly. I'd love to try some more dishes made with such skill. Unlike Thai and Malaysian, Vietnamese was one SE Asian cuisine that Edinburgh has been short on in recent years, but not anymore. This place is already an institution and is sure to grow from here."}
{"label":1,"sentence":"I feel like Pizza Parma is a prime example of \\\"\"don't judge a book by its cover.\\\"\" When you walk by Pizza Parma while downtown, it's pretty easy to write it off, especially when there's so many fine dining options in the area now. It doesn't help that the place tends to be pretty empty, at least from what I've observed - a lack of visible patrons definitely can keep people away. But today I decided to give them a shot, because I really didn't want to stop in anywhere for a big meal - I just wanted a cheap piece of pizza.\\n\\nThough the place does have a \\\"\"dive-y\\\"\" feel to it, it did look very clean and had a welcoming atmosphere once I ventured on in. The tables and chairs - which were mostly the elevated and interconnected kind - admittedly looked a little worn down, but they weren't gross or anything like that. Since I knew I'd likely be eating in a few hours I opted to just eat a plain piece of cheese pizza to hold me over. One piece of cheese pizza and one bottle of Dr. Pepper to go with it cost me $4.25 - not bad, in my opinion. And while not fancy by any means the pizza was pretty tasty; it had the right blend of cheese and pizza and the sauce was very flavorful. It was exactly what you'd want when enjoying a plain ol' piece of pizza.\\n\\nI'll definitely keep this place's super quick service, relatively cheap prices and impressive portion sizes in mind from now on - it's good to know that there are places you can get into while downtown like this, and from what I'm hearing\/reading it's worth exploring the menu and eating something other than pizza here. I admit, however, that I may get some food to go next time if I can, as the old elevated and connected chairs and tables in here sounded like they wanted to break apart at any moment...maybe it's time to update them. After all, \\\"\"Dive-y\\\"\" doesn't necessarily have to mean \\\"\"falling apart,\\\"\" right?"}

But most of the time I order the half-and-half which is a plate of a smaller portion of protein pancakes and a dish of their homefries mixed with veggies meats or cheese (there are a couple of options) with an egg on top.  I always have them add a second egg to get the egg-meat-cheese-potato balance just right.\\n\\nIt can be crowded on the weekend, especially during spring training and typical busy tourist times.

{"label":1,"sentence":"My first visit here was for the annual company holiday party and I'm jonesing to come back! The party was in December around 6pm at night - so when we arrived it was dark. The parking lot for The House Brasserie is actually pretty small, but luckily there is valet parking nearby or if you are really lucky, a spot on the street might be available. My husband and I valet parked then walked to the restaurant. Walking up you really get to take in the whole scene. The patio is lighted beautifully at night and feels very welcoming. (A little history:  The House actually used to be an older house converted into a restaurant, so the front \\\"\"yard\\\"\" is the patio, the \\\"\"driveway\\\"\" is the parking, and where a covered garage would be is the bathrooms.) \\n\\nWe were greeted by a hostess and we indicated we were here for the holiday party. She guided us to the back of the patio, where a large canopy was set up with three long tables and plenty of heaters. Everything looked really nice and one of our servers for the evening stopped by for drink orders. Since I looked up the venue before the party, I knew the House was known for its in-house craft cocktails and asked for a menu. She was happy to oblige and came back saying every cocktail is made by hand with fresh ingredients. After mulling it over, I decided on a blueberry and yoghurt liqueur cocktail. After the first sip, I was in heaven. I admit, I almost didn't order it because it had yoghurt liqueur but let me tell you, it made the drink creamy, refreshing, and decadent. I really enjoyed my drink and ordered a few more throughout the evening.\\n\\nWhen we finally sat down to start the multi-course meal, our waitress brought out the House Brisket and Biscuit with chili jam and white cheddar. The brisket was tender and juicy with a hint of spice from the jam. Next appetizer was the Jerk Chicken inside lettuce with cashews, banana and grapes. This was one of my favorite appetizers - it was both sweet and savory. I would definitely order this the next time I am back. Next on the list was the Brussel sprout salad. This had olives and parmesan cheese. This was good, but not my favorite. Finally, the actual entrees starting coming out. First was a delicate salmon atop parmesan white beans with artichokes, tomatoes and pistachios. The salmon was cooked to perfect - a little crunchy on the outside but flakey and moist on the inside. Definitely one of the best salmon dishes I've had.  Next, the Roasted Jidori Chicken with risotto was brought out. The chicken was extremely tender and moist but the risotto.... Oh, this was perfection. It was the perfect texture with mushrooms and oh so tasty. The final entr\\u00e9e was the Creekstone Filet with roasted corn. The filet came out about medium and was extremely tender. At this point, I wasn't sure if I could eat any more but it was heavenly... so I did. For dessert, mini salted caramel shakes were served with fresh house baked cookies. \\n\\nOverall, the entire multi-course meal was amazing. Being able to try so many items off the menu was pure food heaven and prepped me for when I go back. I will definitely be ordering the jerk chicken appetizers and the salmon with a blueberry yoghurt cocktail. If you are ever in the area, definitely check it out. Even if you aren't, grab a date and make plans! This is one of Scottsdale's restaurants that should not be missed."}
{"label":1,"sentence":"First Impression:\\nOrdering a burrito involves deciding between two different sizes of burros? Reg and XL. I went with the regular on account of my personal mission to fight the obesity epidemic, one bite, one burrito at a time. Turns out I was siding with the models on this one, and not those Dove approves. The burrito regular is on the small side, and costs $5.99. I suppose it is intended to lighten my figure and my wallet, simultaneously. Regarding carne asada -- it is indeed legit, there is a lot of flavor packed into the tiny tortilla. Lots of flavor, just the right amount of juice, some fresh onions lightly grilled (also inside), and a side of salsa. The hot salsa, is not spicy, but it has good flavor.\\n\\nOn my second visit I came by on a Sunday morning to try the breakfast burrito. There was a daily special and the XL size cost only $4.50. Filled with chorizo, eggs, beans and cheese and accompanied with a side of salsa, it turned out to be 3\/5 stars. The chorizo was mild, not the kind that would show up at your Grandma's house for breakfast if you were from Douglas, AZ. I found out that the XL size is really a normal people size burrito.
