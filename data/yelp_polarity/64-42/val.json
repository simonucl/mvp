I will stay out of this discussion Yelp is not the time nor place for that, nor can I say that indeed this is the issue affecting my food. \\n\\nFirst, It was not extra spicy at all. Im not scared of the heat, and I expressly said this when ordering. I was told that it isnt a problem that lots of people order extra spicy, and it would be just that. \\n\\nSecond, it just did not seem like there were extra veggies. We order this way because we split and it gives both of us a good amount of everything. \\n\\nThird, the rice was very dry, and tasted old to me.\\n\\nFourth, practically every table in the place was covered in dirty dishes. EW! Maybe there was a staffing issue. At least attempt to clear the tables so folks can sit down and eat. Kinda important!\\n\\nReview time!\\n\\nCurbage: -5 (virtually every table was dirty, and we should have gone across the street to Chipotle.

I noticed the runners were trying to bus tables also. I believe normally this is not the case here. I will say that this practice is very disgusting and should NEVER be practiced. Do you want your meal brought to you by someone who just bussed another dirty table without washing thier hands before touching your plate. i know i dont.)\\n\\nFood taste: 8 (even though the rice was very dry and there seemed to be not enough veggies, and it just was not spicy, the flavor was good)\\n\\nOverall: 5 \\n\\nToday i am on the fence.

Yeah, that pool noodle really failed to perform, give me my 2.99 back.  And they act like they are doing you a favor at that.  These sharks have gotten their last dollar out of me.

He said he'd sold Groupons before and this happened.... so wouldn't you figure he'd plan a different strategy this time to manage all the influx of clients? \\n\\nThe spa is a small clinic-type building where Seth has a room and other massage therapists have other rooms (and other business names) that share a waiting area. \\nThe massage itself was pretty good. I requested deep pressure, and he did a good job of maintaining that while \\\"\"checking in\\\"\" with me twice to ask if the pressure was ok. I've never had my stomach massaged before though. It has never come up in all the massages I've ever had, but he went ahead and did it here without asking me. I didn't  care for it either.....because so much pressure on your abdomen stimulates your digestion and puts pressure on your organs that I didn't care for. I'll leave my digestion to other professionals, thank you.\\n\\nSo at the end of the massage I got up from the table and my neck felt great-especially since the week before I had had a killer tension headache. The only problem, is Seth completely killed my \\\"\"massage buzz\\\"\" by cornering me to purchase a two for $90 deal. Excuse me? I just got up from the table and you're pressuring me to buy this now? It was awkward awkward awkward. This is why I don't go to Massage Envy!!! It would have been more appropriate had he offered this deal and said it was valid for 30days or even better if he emailed me the offer. Instead he said I'd need to pay for it now. No thank you. I didn't appreciate his sales pitch, it was not the appropriate time and made for a weird moment when I was supposed to be enjoying being relaxed."}

I've already visited 3 times within the past month and each time I was not disappointed. The Market Caf\\u00e9 is located off of Central on Pierce in a recently renovated space that once housed the Phoenix Public Market grocery store. But instead of talking about the history, let's talk about my experience at the Market Caf\\u00e9. \\n\\nDuring my first visit, I did a quick overview of their menu and ordered the AZ Burger just to play it safe. The AZ Burger came with green chile, lettuce, cheddar, and their house dressing. The burger was cooked well and the bread that holds all the goodness together is great. I was not disappointed with the burger or the service during my first visit. \\n\\nFor my second visit, I decided to try something else and ordered the grilled cheese which is served on toasted multi-grain bread with sharp cheddar cheese. You're probably reading this and thinking that I could have made the same thing at home. You're right! However, what makes this grilled cheese awesome is the bread. Even though the bread is toasted, it remained a little soft and warm in the middle while the crust had a nice toast to it. In addition to the sandwich, I ordered a side of fries that also didn't disappoint. They were lightly salted and still a tad soft when they were plated and served. My second visit was a success. \\n\\nCan the Phoenix Public Market Caf\\u00e9 go three for three? You bet they can! I went back for a third visit and ordered the fries again but this time I ordered the chicken salad sandwich which is served with basil, pine nuts, arugula, and tomatoes all found between two slices of 9-grain bread. This sandwich packs some amazing flavor and some texture thanks to the bread they used. Whomever the Market Caf\\u00e9 is using as their baker, they should do everything in their power not to lose him\/her. \\n\\nTo date, my experiences at the Market Caf\\u00e9 have been positive thanks to the great food and service. Aaron Chamberlin has done an amazing job with the space and also brought a wonderful yet simple menu to the Downtown Phoenix area. By the way, If you have specific dietary needs (i.e. vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, dairy free), then this is a place you can visit and find something that suits your needs as well. \\n\\nIf you are a supporter of local and enjoy good food, be sure to visit the Market Caf\\u00e9 at the Phoenix Public Market."}

{"label":1,"sentence":"I got to go float with my wife and daughter as a birthday present. My original gift was going to be a pedicure and I am glad I got this instead. We checked the company out online and got to see what floating was all about. We went there and were greeted by Brittany; she was very helpful and went over all the benefits that we would get from floating. We all went into our rooms took our showers and and got cleaned off. I got into my pod and closed the lid and it was amazing that I could float and relax right away. I turned off the light and then the music came on. I float myself in total relax mode and drifting off to sleep. I find that if you use the neck pillow you will be better off. Once I was near the end of my float; I starter stretching in the water and I got out showered off and sat in the lounge and could find myself drifting off in the chair. I drank about 4 glasses of water afterwards. All in all I would recommend this to anyone that has some pain, or high stress in their life. True Rest is a definite winner"}

He's tough in a way that is motivating, not discouraging. I also love how Richelle, the owner, is so smart about nutrition. I have tried diet after diet over the years, talked to nutritionists, etc. and I learned more from Richelle about how eating affects your body than I did from anyone else."}
