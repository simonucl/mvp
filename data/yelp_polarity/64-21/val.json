The rice was unbelievably salty, the steak tasted like New York steak versus the filet mignon it was supposed to come with. The lobster looked as though they bought langostino lobster in bulk at Costco. We ordered two appetizers, shrimp tempura and fried scallops. The tempura was nothing special, 5 stringy pieces of tempura mostly bread about a quarter of it shrimp. I think the only thing worthwhile was the fried scallops, those were good. We ordered two bowls for the kids one chicken and one steak, let's just say your better going to teriyaki madness for 8.95 you get a teriyaki bowl filled with meat rice and vegetables.

I get to the store (3pm, 5\/23\/2013), and I'm checking out the samples outside the store when a saleswoman comes up to me and starts telling me all about the teas. She was very salesy, spoke in an overly aggressive  tone, and couldn't read that I wanted some space to check things out on my own, but whatever - I realized that she was trying to do her job. But then she kept getting under my feet and butting in after I told her that I just wanted to look around. At the counter she shooed another employee away when it was my turn, which definitely made me feel like she's working on commission. She then proceeded to try to up-sell me on everything. She automatically put my purchase in the $7 containers rather than letting me know that she could have put them in regular bags. She measured out 2.5 oz instead of the 2.0 that I originally asked for (though, to be fair, she asked if that was ok & I said yes), and when I asked her to put my tea into bags instead of the canisters, she (very loudly) tried to make me feel cheap by announcing that \\\"\"you're already saving $10.\\\"\" Other customers turned around and looked when she said this. I don't like being made to feel like I'm not spending enough when I just blew $35 on TEA, after the discount. The name on receipt says her name is Stephanie, though I don't know if that's right. There was another gal there who had helped me out the last time I was there, and she was FANTASTIC. She took time, answered my questions, and wasn't pushy.

{"label":0,"sentence":"First off let me say that up until tonight I was a huge fan of Rubios. I would always order their grilled shrimp tacos or bean and cheese burrito. It always tasted fresh and wasn't greasy. However, tonight I decided to try their new California bowl. I was expecting it to be somewhat similar to Chipolte's burrito bowls. Well . . . the concept was, but in reality it was not even close. The rice was clearly over cooked as it was all mushed together and had no flavor. I assume it is called the California bowl because of the guacamole. However, the amount of guacamole was highly disappointing. Once I mixed all the bowl ingredients together, I couldn't even taste the guacamole which is the best part. I added chicken and again highly disappointed with how much chicken they added. I could barely taste that there was even chicken. Overall, the NEW addition to the menu was a huge disappointment. In the future, Chipolte will be the only place I go for a delicious burrito bowl.\\n\\nOn a side note, I was also disappointed when Rubio's stopped carrying carnita's.

My workout routine consists of cardio first thing followed by heavy strength training. Here, despite having a large number of treadmills and ellipticals in reality there are far less than one can see. How so? Because in treadmill roulette, you end up getting on a machine and hope for the best. It usually entails getting on one treadmill, the closest to the entrance, step on it, check the digi pad and find out it doesn't work. it's the treadmill shuffle too, and here are the steps: get on machine, check out pad, it doesn't work, step to the right, get on machine check out pad, it doesn't work, repeat... and once you find a working machine... cardio it up with some pizazz, HU HAH! jazz hands and spirit fingers! Yea, that's my main complaint, all the free weights and machine weights are fine but everything else is a MEH.

{"label":0,"sentence":"***MIX provides a great view of The Strip and the service is very nice, but the food is below average when compared to fine dining spots outside of Las Vegas***\\n\\nMIX is the second Alain Ducasse restaurant I've tried.  The other one was in Tokyo and it was decent but not special.  Occasionally, the food at MIX felt pretty good, but often the food felt a little below average.  The food tastes slightly better than nearby Aureole (and the service is better too), but MIX just does not feel like a great fine dining spot.\\n\\nThe Alain Ducasse name is definitely a draw for MIX, but the atmosphere is too.  MIX sits on the 64th floor of the Mandalay Bay and you get a good view of The Strip (best at night) from most tables; there are some obstructed views.  The dining room is nice--mostly an all white room with white tablecloth; there are splashes of red here and there.  The lounge area is different; it utilizes darker and more typical lounge colors.\\n\\nMIX offers several menu options.  There is an a la carte menu, which features starters and entrees including several Prime steaks.  There is also a seasonal MIX tasting menu as well as a tasting menu comprised of Alain Ducasse signature dishes.  I decided to opt for the Alain Ducasse tasting menu.\\n\\n(Sweet corn soup amuse) The sweet corn flavor was good and it was creamy, but it was way too hot--almost like they zapped it in the microwave.\\n\\n(Assorted bread with butter and peanut butter) The breadbasket was a decent variety of options, but it was just okay.  The addition of peanut butter was interesting, but the actual peanut butter itself was not that great.\\n\\n(Potato gnocchi, asparagus, mushrooms, aged cheese) The gnocchi was okay; it was a little doughy and I prefer gnocchi with a seared outside.  The asparagus was good.  The mushrooms were just okay, but I really liked the aged cheese, which was sharp and hard but still surprisingly creamy and not dry (there should have been more of it on the plate).\\n\\n(Seared foie gras, date puree, lemon confit) I added this as an a la carte item to the tasting menu and the date puree was a good sweet compliment to the more salty foie gras.  The foie gras was not that good though.  It was a little stringy and it was not that smooth or creamy.\\n\\n(Roasted Maine lobster au curry, coconut basmati rice) The lobster was tender, but it just lacked the softness and moistness you get at really great fine dining restaurants. The coconut basmati rice was nice and creamy and the curry sauce was fragrant, but the flavors did not really develop.  It just became a decent curry dish and nothing else.  And because it was such a big portion, it became kind of a task to eat (instead of a really great dish where you can't put your fork down).\\n\\n(Filet mignon rossini, foie gras, black truffle) This was the main course and it was quite rich and heavy.  The filet was decent.  It was cooked okay and was juicy and tender enough, but I did not think the quality of the meat was great.  The foie gras was similar to the a la carte foie gras where it just did not have that velvety smoothness you get with great foie gras (the texture kind of reminded me of when you don't do creme brulee right and it becomes like scrambled egg).\\n\\nThe black truffle was not that great either.  It was probably Australian truffle and not the peak season for it.  This truffle part might be better in the winter.\\n\\n(Mango puree) The first dessert was a palate cleanser and it was not that great.  It was mango puree and a soda foam.  It was just tart and fizzy and not that refreshing.\\n\\n(Baba a 'larmagnac, brioche, blueberry compote, cream) This was a kind of make-your-own dessert because they serve it in parts.  The sponge cake-like brioche sits atop a good blueberry compote and there is very strong brandy on the side for pouring and a very good cream for applying, dipping and such.  As individual parts, this dessert was decent, but I did not really love it as a whole.\\n\\n(Madeleines with chocolate dipping sauce).  I liked that the madeleines were freshly baked, but they were too big.  I wish they had more of a defined edge\/crust.  The chocolate dipping sauce did not have a great flavor and was too thick.\\n\\nDespite a lot of the food being mediocre, the service was very good.  The staff was pleasant and attentive and the food came out at a good pace.\\n\\nPrices were high, but you do get a very generous amount of food with the tasting menu.  And because a lot of the food is rich and heavy, you definitely will not leave hungry.\\n\\nI thought the service at MIX was very good, but the food was about the same quality as Mandalay Bay's other lackluster fine dining spot Aureole.  There is a lot mediocre fine dining in Las Vegas and, unfortunately, Alain Ducasse's MIX falls in that bunch.  If you are looking for better and more contemporary French dining, you should check out L'atelier de Joel Robuchon in the MGM Grand instead.\\n\\nThe Mandalay Bay offers both complimentary valet and self parking."}

And in a big way.\\n\\nThe laser tag here is from the Laser Force company, which is the same company that ran the standalone Laser Force outlet at Sunset\/Pecos for several years before it finally shut down. It's largely the same experience - the equipment is easy to use, and the venue is a good size and has plenty of surprises. Granted, the arena isn't as big as that of their standalone venue of the past, but this is still a respectable place to play laser tag, and it definitely trumps the other places remaining in the city. I'll be returning here, and often. The experience is a whole lot of fun, easy to learn but tough to master. Plus, it's fun for all ages.\\n\\nThe mini golf course is solid, though not the best of its kind - although I guess I kind of have been spoiled by the KISS mini golf course that opened up a few months back. All things considered though, it's cool to finally have a blacklit indoor mini golf course in the Henderson area - and it's still a lot of fun to experience.\\n\\nThere is also an arcade, which includes games of change you can earn tickets at to get prizes.

I don't know.\\n\\nThe concept gets 5 stars, but I'm only going to give it 4 stars. The biggest issue for me is the wait. I've waited as long as 45 minutes before. I think this family owned business can use an efficiency lesson from McDonald's or Chipotle or Jimmy Johns. Ridiculous! Did they just kill the cow after I made my order?"}
{"label":1,"sentence":"So my boyfriend and I come here alllll the time. It is a little hole in the wall but a hidden jem. I am a total dive bar girl and love love that it is right off the strip! We are pretty new to the Las Vegas area and I was nervous to go in at first but drove by many times and was wanting to check it out. I just didnt want to walk in and there be only regulars...it wasn't like that at all like that considering it is soo close to the strip..duh Crystal! So $1 beers is where I will start..helll yes! They have some cheap bar food too, I have only tried the dogs... you get a hot dog and Bud for $2.50, we go for the brat and Amber for $3.00. $3.00 shots of Crown is just flat out awesome, I am not into Patron but they do shots for $4 and I know that is a steal! We are talking real shots too, not half a shot. All the lady bartenders are great and the bouncers are really nice and keep all the creeps away if need-be. Have the brunett bartender make you a vegas bomb she her style...holy YUM and STIFF...thats my kind of fruity shot! \\nThe ONLY reason I give it 4 stars instead of  5 is because there is no small dancing area to dance to their great music pumping out of the junk box...My friend was dancing around and was told to stop so that is lame but I do understand it is not a place for dancing too. \\nAnyways you should definitley check it out!

{"label":1,"sentence":"In January (when I was in AZ last) I brought my dining room chairs to Giovanni. He offered to come get them the next day, but I was anxious to get them started as I was in town for a limited amount of time. I mentioned to Giovanni how important it was to me that they were done on time, as this is a vacation rental and I had to have them in place for the next guest before I left town. The chairs were back two days earlier then promised and they were delivered. \\n\\nThe work was outstanding. The folds were all exactly the same size and in the same location on each chair. It looked like it was done by a machine, not by hand because it was so precise. The fabric (pleather) was tight and still is. He also refilled them with a very dense foam and that is holding up beautifully.\\n\\nI highly recommend them to yelp users and have personally recommended them to friends."}

I haven't explored a \\\"\"lot\\\"\" of the menu yet...because it's a LOT of menu! But everything I've had so far has been very good! I've had burgers on a couple of occasions (seriously - these are GOOD, fresh, not-pre-fab burgers), and the Reuben burger is my favorite! When they say you won't leave hungry...you WON'T leave hungry!!! I've also had the shrimp po' boy and it was hot, fresh and the avocado and lime mayo MADE the sammich!!! And I stopped by one night with a friend and we shared a spicy beef quesadilla and two French onion soups! Warm, filling and happy-making! The place can get PACKED, especially when the car stuff is going on out back - but service is always good. If they're a little slow or make a mistake, they're very quick to apologize and give an incentive to come back next time!

Service was great as well.  I must say they make an awesome gai mei bao. The only thing is this place was pretty pricy.  In Los Angeles, you can get some great dim sum for $1 an item!"}

Short story is that I LOVED the pizza so much that I demolished 3 whole slices - and their slices are not small. \\n\\nI have yet to try their sandwiches which seem to be their specialty but the fiance loves them and he was right about the pizza so I'm sure I'll be happy once I get my chance to taste test."}
{"label":1,"sentence":"Really great massage. I was gifted a certificate for an hour deep tissue massage over the summer, and had held off on using it until after the holidays. Scheduling an appointment was easy since the masseuse, Lisa, has her own office; however, the internet scheduling is defunct, so be sure to call instead. Despite arriving seven minutes late (I thought the office was located up the street from me, but it's located way on the west side of town around Tenaya and Buffalo, near Summerlin- my bad) Lisa took her time. I mean REALLY took her time. My massage began around 3:00pm and Lisa worked on me, despite charging me for only an hour, until 5:00pm. I've had a lot of massages, and Lisa's style was particularly skillful and caring. She likes to make a little bit of small talk while working, which I didn't mind. She also used this new pressurized heating thing on my back, I can't remember what it was called but it felt amazing. Overall, I would recommend her to anyone looking for a quality, inexpensive, non-hotel massage."}

{"label":1,"sentence":"The first time I noticed Hef's was YEARS ago. There was a sign outside advertising their happy hour oyster, wings and shrimp. I meant to go back to try the crazy cheap specials, but slowly forgot all about Hef's through the years.\\n\\nRecently, I had an oyster craving and Hef's came to mind. I was able to stop by and luckily, they STILL have the same specials! The prices went up a little bit, but are still reasonable. Oysters (cooked\/raw), wings (mild\/hot\/barbalo) and shrimp (grilled\/raw) are all $.60 each. For $.60, the oysters are pretty fresh and decent in size. Although the size does vary by season, the overall quality is pretty good. If you're not much of an oyster fan, the Barbalo wings are to die for! What is Barbalo, you ask? It is a mix of buffalo and BBQ wings of course (which sounded amazing, which it amazingly was!) The wings are drenched in this dark redish\/brown sauce (Barbalo sauce I presume) and still retains its crunchy texture. All wings are made fresh to order! I'm not much of a shrimp fan, but maybe you can try and let me know if I'm missing out.\\n\\nThe perfect complement to my meal was a quaint space with a lit fountain for outside seating. Charlotte is slowly warming up and it was a beautiful day to enjoy the fresh air (even the pollen was low that day!)"}

Streetcar was nice, even though I HATE CATFISH!!! The shrimpies were so delicious and big, the oysters nice and crispy... The bread is wonderful!! The Bourbon street was good. I inhaled it, so I don't remember much... The meat wasn't chewy and grisly, that was nice. There was an interesting taste of peanut in the gravy sauce... I bought 2 larges, expecting leftovers. Oh man, large is humongous!! WOW!!! Nice for leftovers. Oh, and then you get some nice cajun seasoned chips. Amazing deal. \\nAlso got a side of fried okra so I could nibble on the drive home.

{"label":1,"sentence":"There is only one place I would want a person to sell like a car salesman, and thats here at Ferraro's!  The waiter who was assigned to our party was just like Alfred from Batman!  He was at our beck and call.  He was attentive to our needs, very knowledgeable of the Italian food lingo and he wheeled n' dealed us on the most prestigious dishes on the menu.  Not to mention his team of bus persons who hawked us for any breadcrumbs to be immediately scraped off the table.  \\nHonest to say, I've been tired of the Italian food fare.  If it wasn't for a deal breaker I found on Restaraunts.com, I would have never considered dining at this stallion of a venue.  Needless to say, The menu items were more on the Bucket O' Gold side, but because of the quality and taste of the food, it was money well spent.  We ordered a number of items on the menu, but the one most memorable dish, out of all things, was the calamari!  The squid was fresh and fried to perfection!  If ya gotta PYT, take her here to start things off.. the ambiance is very dramatic.

Hotel was very clean and well kept.  Pool area didn't have enough lounge chairs, but otherwise was great.  Food around the pool was ok--definitely nothing special.   Ordered the sliders and they were too salty.  Drinks were good though.   The DJT restaurant offered good breakfast but service was slow as molasses.   No casino on the property,  but I don't gamble so that was actually a plus.

Worth knowing: BF&F is one of the few places you can get Benjamin Moore now that Ace has gone the way of Valspar. \\n\\n2. These guys have everything. It's sort of scary actually. Need a hose? They have them. How about a mixing bowl? Yup. Belts, socks, pipe, rope, ladders, goat troughs... outside of maybe organic vegetables, I can't think of something they don't stock. AND they probably have organic seeds this time of year so you can GROW your own vegetables. So I'm taking that back. \\n\\n3. The fine folks up front are friendly. The rare occasion I need to return something it's no bother, quick and painless. And checkers are so efficient I never find myself waiting in line. \\n\\nSome things I wish were a bit better:\\n\\n1. Organization. It takes me forever to find something. This could be because I am not quick to ask, but I feel like with some more signage and maybe a bit more order, these guys could clear up a lot of shopping confusion. \\n\\n2. It always smells of rubber\/automotive. I'm not certain if this is because the tire area is practically inside and the garage just next door, but it's a foul order, and one that I can't stand for too long. \\n\\nAll in all though, the place is really a one stop shop for several home\/agricultural needs. Just plan to spend a bit longer navigating the place and maybe bring a nose plug."}
