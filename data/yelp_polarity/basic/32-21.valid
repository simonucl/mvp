Where do I begin??? \nThis place is simply not good! We ordered a surf and turf to share that came with soup, salad and veggies. This was 39.99 plus a share charge. They ask if you want fried rice or white rice, and they don't let you know that they are going to up charge if you choose the fried rice. The rice was unbelievably salty, the steak tasted like New York steak versus the filet mignon it was supposed to come with. The lobster looked as though they bought langostino lobster in bulk at Costco. We ordered two appetizers, shrimp tempura and fried scallops. The tempura was nothing special, 5 stringy pieces of tempura mostly bread about a quarter of it shrimp. I think the only thing worthwhile was the fried scallops, those were good. We ordered two bowls for the kids one chicken and one steak, let's just say your better going to teriyaki madness for 8.95 you get a teriyaki bowl filled with meat rice and vegetables. Our waitress was nice as was the young hostess, aside from that I'd have to say this is the worst place to have hibachi in town. Our total bill was 116.00 WITHOUT alcoholic beverages, and we left still feeling hungry.	0
OMG...do not get scammed into this horrible experience....dinner for 2 buy one get one is a complete hoax!!!! Waiter didn't care...even was rude and charged us 63 dollars instead of 32 dollars...husband is sick and has been going to bathroom all day...he ate the calamari that we think was bad because me and my daughter didn't eat that....we love Braziliian Steak houses...i.e. Texas De brazil,,and others here in Vegas...but this one was something else and by that I mean HORRIBLE.....	0
Ok, so I've never been a fan of Domino's in the past and I can't say much has changed since they said they had redone their recipe for a \""better\"" pizza. The crust is just too overly seasoned. That really turns me off. It tastes like they put way too much garlic powder combined with Mrs. Dash on it, ew.\n\nThe texture is ok, but it's really not doing it for me. I prefer Pizza Hut or Papa John's still if I'm going for a cheap pizza on the quick.	0
Visit Date:  10/4/14\n\nThis. Is slowly getting worse. .. today strike 2.  Last week was not good, today the same. Eggs over cooked, potatos burnt. Quality is dropping.  I'll give this 1 more chance.	0
It's a cute place from the outside, VERY small inside, and the food is really mediocre.  The hamburgers were barely edible and the fries weren't even as good as McDonald's.  The servers were nice but I won't go here again.	0
It's Friday afternoon 2:45 pm you'd think the drive thru would be quicker than the last time I was in it (on a Sat 22min), nope 10 minutes. 2cars ahead of me. I'm not ever coming back to this one. What a joke.	0
When my friend and I were walking in, he noted that he didn't fully understand why there would be a restaurant named \""Twin Peaks\"". By the time we were seated, it became immediately clear that the title had nothing to do with actual mountains or the great outdoors. The service was friendly and pleasant, though the server did ask me \""What does hoppy mean?\"" when I asked her what the hoppiest beer on tap was. The food isn't great, and the beer taps are average. The BBQ Pulled Pork Nachos were something fiercely awful - Guy Fieri is probably kicking himself that he doesn't have it featured in his restaurants. To their credit, there are tons of televisions around to watch whatever sports are on (yippee).\n\nUltimately, the selling points for this place are the massive amounts of televisions and the scenery that only a heterosexual male with no greater sense of appetite can enjoy. The service seemed friendly enough, but the food was bleh.	0
I had just received a coupon from Starbuck's for $10 off a $30 purchase at Teavana, so I decided to buy some tea for my husband as a present. (The tea at Teavana is good but really expensive, so we definitely consider it an indulgence.) I get to the store (3pm, 5/23/2013), and I'm checking out the samples outside the store when a saleswoman comes up to me and starts telling me all about the teas. She was very salesy, spoke in an overly aggressive  tone, and couldn't read that I wanted some space to check things out on my own, but whatever - I realized that she was trying to do her job. But then she kept getting under my feet and butting in after I told her that I just wanted to look around. At the counter she shooed another employee away when it was my turn, which definitely made me feel like she's working on commission. She then proceeded to try to up-sell me on everything. She automatically put my purchase in the $7 containers rather than letting me know that she could have put them in regular bags. She measured out 2.5 oz instead of the 2.0 that I originally asked for (though, to be fair, she asked if that was ok & I said yes), and when I asked her to put my tea into bags instead of the canisters, she (very loudly) tried to make me feel cheap by announcing that \""you're already saving $10.\"" Other customers turned around and looked when she said this. I don't like being made to feel like I'm not spending enough when I just blew $35 on TEA, after the discount. The name on receipt says her name is Stephanie, though I don't know if that's right. There was another gal there who had helped me out the last time I was there, and she was FANTASTIC. She took time, answered my questions, and wasn't pushy. I wish she hadn't already been busy helping someone else; it would have been a completely different experience. As it was, I walked away feeling lousy that I had just spent so much money instead of feeling excited to surprise my husband.	0
This is a review of the wings; there are a lot of other items on the menu to try.  I got the 8 wings/fries combo plate and a Coke for about $10.  I found the wings tough and dry, even with the sweet BBQ sauce.  A much better alternative is The Chicken Shack (and I intend on visiting Buffalo Wild Wings soon).  The sad part is that it was completely empty on a Saturday afternoon (probably in part because there was no A/C), and everybody kept passing this place up in favor of Teriyaki Madness, right next door.  I think the reason for the poor business is the location...it's tucked away in the corner of a shopping center where the main attraction is a 24-Hour Fitness...obviously those types of people aren't going to get their jollies throwing away all their hard work on chicken wings.  Oh well.	0
I'm not just hating because of the skimpy outfits (that most of the women don't have the body to pull off)...the food's just bad. I was excited to see something go in where Earl's was because it has a great outdoor space (even though it's right off the freeway) and went shortly after they opened, but was quite underwhelmed. I have heard they have a great TV set up to watch football games though.	0
Had the combo plate.  Three out of four meats were dry/overcooked.  Last time, I had pulled turkey, so dry nearly inedible.  This can't be the best bbq around...	0
Do not move here!!! Have been a tenant for to long,  things to expect: drugs, shootings, robberies, killings 2 within 4 years with one happening 2 doors away. Harassment from the always changing property management, property poorly kept do not expect to get anything fixed in a timely  manner.DO NOT BRING FAMILY HERE THEY HATE KIDS! !!!	0
This place is the worst restaurant in Vegas. Services, food, and dinning area are failed. I was surprised that  Health Dept shut it down SO LATE in July 2014.\n\nMy family was dinning there few times and the foods and services are getting worse and worse. I speak their language and hear they bad month their customers, who obviously dont understand Chinese. Services is the worst part, i have to go to their stations to get my tea cups after i asked for assistance about missing tea cups from our table. It took me few minutes to find 2 clean cups! \n\nYes, they serve dim sum all day, BIG DEAL! Those dim sum will stay in the carts until they are sold. The heat in those carts are weak, go figure how fresh they are.\nBe careful what they charge u on the check! We found couple times they over charged us on what we did not order.\n\nWe are going dim sum somewhere else nowadays. We will never return to this place unless it has a new owner. This will happen really soon. Mark my word!	0
My review is not intended for the rooms but only the establishment. \nTHIS IS NOT HANDICAPPED FRIENDLY.  \nI went there today for Happy Hour.  When I pulled up to the front entrance I asked about where the handicapped parking was as I did not see any close by.  The directed me to a lot which was far off the beaten path.  I again drove up to the front and proceeded to park nearby where I saw other cars parked.  I was immediately told that I could not park there.  I told them that their handicapped lot was too far for any handicapped person to walk.  They said I could leave the car there but only if I gave them my keys.  I do not give anyone myt car keys.  They called the manager who said he could arrange for someone to follow me to the handicapped lot and bring me back.\nMy other complaint is that when I tried to get back into the restaurant from the patio the doors are too heavy and no button for handicapped to push to open the doors.\nI would not recommend this place for people who are handicapped or even people who have a problem with walking or who are not strength builders.  You need to be physically fit to stay here.	0
So we were looking for something different in Tempe. Well, we found it. So far the worst Italian I've had in the valley. Look at my stats. One star reviews are rare for me. I'll usually go back at least once to give them another chance. But I'll make an exception in this case, because there's no way I'm ever goin' back to this place.\n\nShould have known something was up when the waitress brought our drinks over talking on a cordless phone. \""No,\"" she said. \""I can't talk right now. No. I'm working. I'm kind of bringing someone their drinks. Can I call you back? I'll call you back. Bye.\"" When she put the phone down we ordered the eggplant parmesan. Big mistake. Looked and tasted like someone hid it at the bottom of the deep fryer and forgot about it. For 3 days. There wasn't much eggplant left, and what eggplant was left didn't taste much like eggplant. More like... cardboard. mmmm... cardboard parmesan. Seriously, it was gross. Sad thing was we were absolutely starving and on our way to a show so we ate it. Well, most of it. It came with a side of spaghetti, which was all right. Not as gross as the eggplant, but still not good.\n\nThought I'd give them a chance to redeem themselves with a canoli for dessert. Worst canoli ever. The dough was hard and stale, and the filling was strangely sour and so thick that technically I don't think it could be classified as cream. More like... gel.\n\nBad service, bad food. Beware.	0
Not only can't they get the order correct, they can't put everything in the bag that I paid for.\nI'm never comming back you brainless morons.\nFYA.	0
I figured this place would be like Fat Tuesday's, but I was wrong.  The drinks are weak and too sweet.\n\nI tried the Pina Coloda and it tasted like there was a cup of sugar in it.	0
I was staying at the Hilton Grand Vacations across the street and down a way. I ended up gambling at the Riviera every day. Most bartenders at the poker bar are very nice and helpful. Many of the dealers are just nasty! James and Bruce are awesome. After losing hundreds to Tang, without even a smile, I wonder why anyone would keep going back to 3 card poker. If I was with the guys and not my family, I would never play here!	0
This place was TERRIBLE! I had a tough time finding something on the menu. Absolutely nothing sounded delicious and I was tempted to walk out, but we had already ordered our drinks. \n\nI ended up going with the classic club... for $17, mind you. Imagine my surprise when I receive a sandwich with \""fake\"" turkey (you know the kind where its all wet and sort of on the slimy side,.... not slightly dry and freshly carved like it should be?) \n....and a thick slice of sweaty cheddar cheese! \n\nSeriously? I feel completely ripped off and I honestly want to see Aaron Sanchez's food network membership revoked. \n\nP.S. sprinkling dried pepper flakes on slices of pickle does not make you creative!!!!!!!!	0
So you're not into gambling and you're not much of a shopper and you're looking for something equally as wasteful to do with your last $20 or $40, set up an appointment at this dermatologist office! \n\nI'm pretty sure the only thing redeeming about this visit was the front office staff that checked me in (shocking for a doctor's office, I know). \n\nI merely wanted to check in with my epidermis, being the sun bather I tend to be in the summer months, I made my appointment. I showed up early and they were able take me in early which was fantastic. \n\nLet's just say that I have sneezed and it has lasted longer than the time the doctor spent \""evaluating\"" my flesh. \n\nUnless your face, or body is covered in undefinable matter, painful to look at or abnormal in a major way, don't waste your time or cash at this joint. \n\nNo care, no time and no concern was shown to me during this visit; rolling down my car windows and letting go of the $40 would have even sufficed as a more rewarding experience in my opinion.	0
I'm only giving 1 star because it won't let me give zero stars. We contracted through Lowe's who hired Beano's to install carpet in our entire upstairs. The installer arrived and immediately appeared afraid of our dogs (which he couldn't see, but could only hear barking). He then went upstairs and pulled back a section of carpet that has had furniture on it for the last 12 years. There were stains on the under side of the carpet, presumably from the previous owner. He then leaves our house, calls Lowe's, and tells them that our house is unsanitary and wreaks of urine. We clean our carpets monthly! Lowe's told us we had to remove the carpet and bleach the floor before they would install the carpet. I'm pregnant! We can't bleach the floors. We are getting a refund and refusing to do business with Lowe's or Beano's ever again!	0
I will most definitely NEVER eat here simply based on the fact how incredibly rude the owners are. I am not sure if ownership changed, but these two individuals are absolutely Appalling.	0
I had a good time here last weekend and would have reviewed much higher, until I looked at my bank statement! The day after visiting Surrender I had 5 pending transactions from the club on my bank statement - I should have only had 2. The same thing happened to one of my friends, but she had 6 charges. We paid for drinks at different bars within the club, so it wasn't just a fluke. After calling our banks they explained we had to wait until the charges actually went through (up to 3 days) to dispute them. Currently I have 2 incorrect charges that went through and another pending. I called to dispute them with the club, and conveniently the only person who can help me with this (according to the woman who answered the phone) works 10-4, so I will have to call during my working hours to try and get this settled. I'm beyond annoyed and will not recommend that anyone visit Surrender.	0
the wait here is RIDICULOUS!!! i made an appointment on my iPhone app the day before, when i show up for my appt, i still have to wait an extra hour just to exchange an iPad because my nephew dropped on the floor, the whole exchange took less than 5 mins. So what's the point of making an appt just to wait an hour for a 5 mins transaction that cost me an extra $250???	0
Let's start with the basics. We booked a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor for one week. When we arrived, we were told that only smoking rooms on smoking floors were available. The entire party (we booked several rooms) registered displeasure with this but we were told there were no other options. Period. The manager assured us that it would be barely noticeable. Well, as you can imagine, when we stepped onto the tenth floor, we virtually needed an oxygen mask. The odor was strong enough to be revolting. Later that night, the smell of weed was so over-powering that we elected to hit The Strip a bit early rather than rest. The next day, we all requested a room-change and reported the weed stench (which management made a note of and indicated that security would investigate). We were promptly moved. However, when we arrived in our new room and opened our luggage, everything reeked of smoke. (Right now, our suitcases are open in the foyer in an attempt to air them out ... still, we are concerned we may have to dispose of it). Our clothes, of course, can be washed. (We picked up \""Tide with Frebreze,\"" so that should help). \n\nNow, please note that the door to the rooms need to be pulled sharply closed. (This applied to all rooms). Be SUPER vigilant of this. One of the folks in our party TWICE forgot to pull the door sharply closed and was lucky that no one robbed her. (Also, watch for the privacy tags, these can block the door from closing also). \n\nKeep an eye on the fine print. I cannot emphasize this enough. You receive internet service in the resort fee ($28.00 a day ... no exceptions for anyone). HOWEVER, this is for ONE device. Therefore, if you and your boyfriend/girlfriend each have a device, it is an additional $19.99 a day. If you add your phone, an additional $19.99 a day. This is NOT entirely noticeable ... it is in the fine-print, and we were lucky enough to notice it. \n\nWe were excited to have a mini-fridge since we wanted to buy some pastries at Bouchon for the morning. However, the odor was unreal. This fridge went unused. \n\nThe crowd who seems to frequent this hotel is a \""little rough.\"" So keep a close eye on your belongings. (We had several awkward elevator rides with some truly stoned and shady characters .... two of whom appeared indigent). This is not a Wynn, Bellagio, or Four Seasons.\n\nFinally, if you book this hotel with the promise of amenities, print that screen. When we arrived, we were not given our two-per-room free buffet vouchers. We were told that was not an option. When I explained that it was a part of the package, the girl checking us in said it was not and asked for proof. I asked her how I could prove it ... she requested a screen-shot (LOL!) or a print out. I had to be \""that person\"" and request a manager who gave us the comps \""as a favor to us.\"" (Double LOL!)\n\nNote: there is no concierge at this hotel. So if you need show-tickets, they will try to get you to visit the individual casinos. What a waste of time. Instead, just call the casino and then they will direct you to a sister-casino to pick up the tickets. For example, some of us wanted to see Carrot Top, so we called the Luxor and then were permitted to pick up tickets as The Mirage ... one casino north). Other resorts we have frequented have a concierge who will get tickets for a party. These are not people who place the customer first.\n\nBook this hotel with extreme caution.	0
Long John Silver's Store 31329 E Flamingo and Maryland Pkwy Las Vegas NV.\n\nWent to this store ar12:33 PM today. What a disaster. The fish tasted like chicken, the fries tasted like chicken, the hush puppies (which were under cooked and doughy) tasted like chicken. All of it tasted like the oil was old and over used.  The crab cake tasted like salmon. No excuse for this. The table was dirty and even after being wiped down twice had food and gunk left on it. Both me and my friend both barely made it to a toilet with the runs after eating there. Stay away if you value your health and taste buds.	0
This is the only \""affordable\"" and non-sit down place to eat at the Wynn which frustrated the hell out of me since this place didn't meet my high expectations of what should be in the Wynn.\n\n The first meal I had here was the ham and cheese panini which they served to me cold in the middle; the cheese wasn't even melted. When I took it back they reheated it and it was STILL cold in the middle. I just gave up after that because it was 3:00AM, I was partially drunk/hunover and just couldn't care enough to make a stink.\n\nI had breakfast and snacks here throughout my stay and I'd have to say my favorite things to eat here were the steel cut oatmeal and bran muffin. Pastries here were pretty decent.  All the other stuff was just not worth the inflated Vegas prices.	0
seriously don't stay here if you can help it.  I guess whoever owns this place hires people on a regular basis, people who are coming and going.  Example: they will hire someone who is staying in the city for 2 weeks and in exchange they get free room and board.  So these are the people who are in \""charge\"" when you stay at this place.  Not very experienced people.\n\nSo first of all their \""gated parking\"" is indeed gated, but it's the kind that you actually have to physically lock yourself...like pull open the gate and lock it every time you move your car.  Which is better than no gated parking i guess because it's pretty ghetto over there.\n\nI saw hookers walking around with their tits out, got solicited  for sex several times just trying to walk up to fremont (not wearing anything sexual at all), and also was asked repetitively if i wanted to buy crack...seriously.\n\nThis I could deal with...i kind of expected it actually, you are only paying $18 a night.  But i didn't expect for one of the hostel managers to beat the shit out of someone in the room above me at 3am, because he hadn't payed his rent on time.\n\nI listened to the hostel manager beat the crap out of someone for about an hour and a half before the cops showed up to take them both to jail.  It was absolutely terrifying since it sounded like one of them was going to die.  \n\nI changed hotel rooms the next day...the golden nugget was only $45 a night, $25 bucks more than what i was paying to stay at that place.  So if you can help it do not stay there, it's dangerous and it really doesn't cost too much more to stay at a best western or some other cheap place.\n\nIf you really can't afford to go somewhere else, at least you've been warned.	0
Don't stay at this hotel. I don't do reviews but this one definitely stood out. After 9hours of drive and after waiting 30mins for check-in, we were sent to an UNCLEAN ROOM. The receptionist didn't even bother to apologize at all. Worst customer service ever.	0
Closed? I went over here hoping to play badminton but it was closed. Hoping to find out if you have moved somewhere else.	0
the service here is like shit\n\nmat thang nao thang nay nhu cai lon cua con di me no .	0
I've stayed here a couple times and had 2 totally different experiences. The first time I was upgraded to a larger room for free and the room was good. The second time, however...\n\nFirst they gave us a room on the 1st floor, where we had a great view of the taxi stand. The AC didn't work. We immediately complained (it was August, for God's sake) and were sent to a different room on an upper floor. The AC worked about 1% better. We set it to 60 and 3 days later when we left it was maybe 78 in the room.\n\nI think the same dishes were left in the hallway across from us the entire time we were there. \n\nHorrible experience, I'd never go there again!	0
Delicious food- friend pickles are to die for- \n\nAwesome bartenders and cocktails \n\n\nMust try their Monday Night Cap! With $5 snacks and awesome drink specials!	1
How strange to read the bad reviews. I am picky and thought my sandwich was delish and wonderful. The service was excellent. One of the owners was there and he was delightful to talk too. Hmmmmm, not sure how it stacks up to an authentic steak from Philly since I have never been there to have one but I know who to send to find out. I think Wiz is gross so I had the regular Roast Beef sandwich with provolone, onions and banana peppers and it was great! Their sweet potato fries were good too. They are also open 24/7 which is amazing in itself. Check it out. Maybe the after bar crowd suffers. I don't know but it was fine when we went on Black Friday. It was not busy nor rude. We had a Groupon so even better.	1
Sehr guter Italiener!! \nDie Pizza wird mitten im Restaurant vor den Augen der G\u00e4ste zubereitet und ist super lecker. Der Service ist gut und die Preise angemessen.\nEinziger Kritikpunkt: Tische und St\u00fchle im Freien h\u00e4tten vor dem Essen abgeputzt werden k\u00f6nnen. Deswegen \""nur\"" 4 von 5 Sternen	1
Having just moved from Seattle to Glendale AZ 4 months ago, I needed to find someone who cleaned carpets. I asked a few people who are locals to the area.\n\nI had Leo's Carpet Cleaning  out to my home after seeing reviews of others on Facebook who have used Leo's Carpet Cleaning. I emailed Leo on Monday and got quote by phone. Leo charges by size of home.\n\n I'm in a single story home and given a quote of $125. Two Story is $225. I scheduled an appoint for Thursday (today) . Leo showed up on time ( which I appreciate since I work from home). He did not rush the job, in fact he was here 2 hours. Leo really cares about his work and it showed in his hard work. Leo has a helper who is also great and just as attentive as Leo to detail.\n\nA  great job, my carpet are off white and left in great shape. I couldn't be any more happier! I will call on this company for regular service from here on.	1
A great place to catch a sporting event and have a drink. It was a clean well organized place. The service was really good. The chicken zingers and sliders came out quick and hot. Too bad they dont have any locations in cali.	1
Yelp 100 Challenge: 32/100\n\n26 postures. 90 minutes. 105\u00b0 room at 40% humidity. Prepare to sweat like a pig! The heat is intense.There will be times during class when you'll be wondering why you're doing this to yourself. You might even question your own sanity.\n\n This is what was bouncing around my head on my first class back....\n\nWhat's wrong with me? Why am I doing this again?\nI'm crazy. I've literally lost my mind.\nEwwww.. I'm still sweating.\nI'm going to pass out. \nWhy can't I bend like that? \nWater! Water! Water!\nI'm going to do this again tomorrow?!\n\nMake no mistake about it-- Bikram will be one of the most intense workouts you will ever do. It will also be one of the most rewarding things you will ever do. This is why I keep coming back for more. \n\nI've hopped around to various 'hot yoga' studios in the Vegas area. What I've learned is that the right instructor can make all the difference in the world. I am happy to report that every instructor I've had has been very supportive, motivating, and uplifiting. They go out of thier way to make sure sure everyone feels welcomed and even make a point to learn your name.  \n\nThe studio is gorgeous. It's squeaky clean and updated with Flotex Eco-Carpet. Why is that awesome? This is the ONLY studio that doesn't have the 'Funky Bikram Smell' that I've experienced at other studios. Yep, you heard that right. NO. FUNKY. SMELLS. Yippee! \n\nTheir locker room is clean and modern. No need to bring a padlock to class. You can easily program your own code and your personal items are easily secured in your choice of lockers. They also provide toiletry items if you prefer to shower and primp on-site.\n\nHands down, this is my favorite place for Bikram. I'm a loyal customer and will contunue my Bikram journey at this studio. If you're looking to give it a whril, come here.  When you're ready to check this place out, I highly suggest visiting their website to view their new student tips so you can properly prepare. \n\nNamaste.	1
Went back the next day with my son and mom and the fries were still specatular.  This time I had a stromboli and it was pretty good.	1
My daughter loves this store with that much Hello Kitty going on it's a three year old girls dream. The prices are a little hard to figure out some things are really good deals and some are just overpriced. The owner knows us when we come in now and they are all really friendly. The nice bonus is they are open fairly late. This is also a great place for last minute gifts on the way to kid B-day partys.	1
Only thing missing is a pool. Also the track iirc is 1/8th miles, so it takes a LOT of laps to get any real jogging in. Other than that this place is great.	1
This is my local hang out for breakfast. I am here all the time and each time it is always great. I have lived for quite sometime and have eaten quite a few breakfasts in all sorts of areas. This is probably the place the reminds me best of traditions.\n\nA good french toast is such a treat in this day and age that I especially appreciate the greatness of such a restaurant.\n\nI miss the butter milk pancakes as much as anyone but you can't have everything alll the time. There are certain compromises that need to be made.	1
It's been tough for me the past few years, being a laser tag fan in the Henderson area. Ultrazone and Laser Force are gone. For years, the only options have been to drive across town to Laser Quest or the Adventure Dome, and neither one of them are terribly great experiences. When I heard a new laser tag place was opening close to home, I was pretty damn pleased, albeit skeptical.\n\nI finally went over and tried this place to day, and I have something to say:\n\nLaser tag is BACK. And in a big way.\n\nThe laser tag here is from the Laser Force company, which is the same company that ran the standalone Laser Force outlet at Sunset/Pecos for several years before it finally shut down. It's largely the same experience - the equipment is easy to use, and the venue is a good size and has plenty of surprises. Granted, the arena isn't as big as that of their standalone venue of the past, but this is still a respectable place to play laser tag, and it definitely trumps the other places remaining in the city. I'll be returning here, and often. The experience is a whole lot of fun, easy to learn but tough to master. Plus, it's fun for all ages.\n\nThe mini golf course is solid, though not the best of its kind - although I guess I kind of have been spoiled by the KISS mini golf course that opened up a few months back. All things considered though, it's cool to finally have a blacklit indoor mini golf course in the Henderson area - and it's still a lot of fun to experience.\n\nThere is also an arcade, which includes games of change you can earn tickets at to get prizes. However, the selection of games is not that great and the prize selection is pretty basic. I would like to see more arcade games in here in the future, preferably some classics. Still, the arcade is a \""side show\"" next to the laser tag and mini golf, so I can't knock points off for this.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that they do have some food available, including pizza, which is nice if you get hungry during your laser tag marathon. The staff are all very friendly and were helpful with any questions I had.\n\nOverall this place comes strongly recommended, any shortcomings are minor.	1
I love the ambiance of this place. We dined on a comfortable, leather sofa in the cozy cellar downstairs. It was candle lit, intimate, and had good mood music playing. It would be a wonderful place to bring a date you would like to impress! We had a bottle of Shiraz wine, mushroom toasts, sliders, tortilla crusted halibut, and some creme brule. Everything was delicious & our server was very knowledgeable. We will DEFINITELY be back!	1
My wife and I visit Vegas at least once a year.  Until I found this place (and others) on Yelp, we used to just have breakfast/brunch in the hotel's anonymous coffee shop.  Meh.\n\n Now that Yelp has opened my eyes, we've tried different places.  The Egg & I is one of our favorites for breakfast (actually brunch since we don't leave the hotel until 10 a.m. or so).  We eat here most often because there is a plethora of different items on their menu to choose from and they are ALL GOOD!  Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat when I'm away from home, so this is important to me.\n\nTo be honest it is pretty difficult to screw up a basic breakfast centered on eggs and breakfast meat.  However, the Egg & I is head and shoulders above the others with various delicious potato and egg treatments, their muffins, and friendly service staff.  Needless to say, we don't eat in hotel coffee shops anymore.  Not only do you get huge quantities of food at the Egg & I, it all tastes great, and what a variety!  If you're not into eggs, they also have waffles, pancakes and french toast, as well as salads and sandwiches.  Also free wifi so you can catch up on news from home & messages while eating.\n\nIf you are like my wife and insist on staying in a big-name Strip resort hotel, do yourself a favor and drive a short distance off the strip to have breakfast and some really tasty food.  Catch a glimpse of what the rest of the City of Las Vegas looks like, and taste real food, not the bland stuff the corporate chains dish out.  You might realize, like I did, that The Strip is not the final destination of your trip to Vegas.\n\nThere are fine dinner restaurants off the Strip as well!  Yelp is here for you.	1
Probably one of my favorite fast food burger joints. Everyone knows about the Animal Style, but it's never on the menu. The burger is great, but the fries are below average (without animal style). The first few bites makes me feel like I'm in heaven, but it gets old pretty quick. Maybe it's just too much sauce. I don't know.\n\nThe concept gets 5 stars, but I'm only going to give it 4 stars. The biggest issue for me is the wait. I've waited as long as 45 minutes before. I think this family owned business can use an efficiency lesson from McDonald's or Chipotle or Jimmy Johns. Ridiculous! Did they just kill the cow after I made my order?	1
So my boyfriend and I come here alllll the time. It is a little hole in the wall but a hidden jem. I am a total dive bar girl and love love that it is right off the strip! We are pretty new to the Las Vegas area and I was nervous to go in at first but drove by many times and was wanting to check it out. I just didnt want to walk in and there be only regulars...it wasn't like that at all like that considering it is soo close to the strip..duh Crystal! So $1 beers is where I will start..helll yes! They have some cheap bar food too, I have only tried the dogs... you get a hot dog and Bud for $2.50, we go for the brat and Amber for $3.00. $3.00 shots of Crown is just flat out awesome, I am not into Patron but they do shots for $4 and I know that is a steal! We are talking real shots too, not half a shot. All the lady bartenders are great and the bouncers are really nice and keep all the creeps away if need-be. Have the brunett bartender make you a vegas bomb she her style...holy YUM and STIFF...thats my kind of fruity shot! \nThe ONLY reason I give it 4 stars instead of  5 is because there is no small dancing area to dance to their great music pumping out of the junk box...My friend was dancing around and was told to stop so that is lame but I do understand it is not a place for dancing too. \nAnyways you should definitley check it out! We take all our friends that come into town there for pre-gaming before going out..you just cant go wrong.	1
Put your dinner in their hands!!\n\nBest nobu meal i have ever had. We just asked them to bring out dish after dish after dish for our group of 12 without ordering from the menu.  Every dish was spot on and better than the last.  Delicious rare ingredients from parts unknown.  Awesome service, awesome drinks.  One of the best meals i have ever had anywhere.  Expensive but amazing.	1
Barrio Queen is an excellent little place right in the center of Scottsdale's shopping district!  When I went, It was my first visit and I wasn't sure what I wanted to try.  I asked the waitress--her name was emily---to surprise me.  She brought me three excellent tacos (street tacos style).  I can't remember which she brought but they were so good, i had her surprise me with three more!    The food and service is excellent here!	1
Favorite dishes: escargot, seafood crepe, mussels, salmon salad, and crab cakes.\nI always come here whenever I go to Vegas just to eat their escargots. Best escargot!!!	1
In January (when I was in AZ last) I brought my dining room chairs to Giovanni. He offered to come get them the next day, but I was anxious to get them started as I was in town for a limited amount of time. I mentioned to Giovanni how important it was to me that they were done on time, as this is a vacation rental and I had to have them in place for the next guest before I left town. The chairs were back two days earlier then promised and they were delivered. \n\nThe work was outstanding. The folds were all exactly the same size and in the same location on each chair. It looked like it was done by a machine, not by hand because it was so precise. The fabric (pleather) was tight and still is. He also refilled them with a very dense foam and that is holding up beautifully.\n\nI highly recommend them to yelp users and have personally recommended them to friends.	1
THE BEST SUSHI I HABE EVER HAD! Always fresh and delicious. My only issue is that this place is super small. If you are sitting at the short tables you don't have any privacy because you might as well be sitting with the people next to you.	1
I love Mitchell's Fish Market.  95% of the time, the food is amazing but, when they mess up, they move heaven and earth to make it better.  The last time we were at Mitchell's, I ordered the lobster and tenderloin skewers.  My lobster was underdone.  The server was amazing and replaced the lobster tail even though I had eaten most of it.  Then, to make our night even better, comped us a dessert.  It's that kind of stellar service that keeps us going back.	1
Love Buffalo Chip!  I've never eaten here but I dig the atmosphere! Fun crowd, pool table, live band, awesome western decor, live bull riding.... all in all a fun way to spend the night if you are looking for something fun and different from the typical Phoenix bar!	1
By far, the BEST buffet in Las Vegas!! They provide a variety of options for all different types of palletes AND the quality of the food is EXCEPTIONAL!! This is DEFINITELY NOT cafeteria food (like most buffets)!! And most importantly, the food presentation is Phenomenal!! Get wicked at Wicked Spoons!!	1
I really enjoy the ice cream,not 2 sweet.....this is the first choice 4 me 2 pick....so damn gd.....	1
I'll admit - I'm a fan of casual kitsch and Phil's fits my mood, when I'm in it! I love all the Coke memorabilia (especially at Christmas time, when the rest of the \""stuff\"" comes out) - and the booths and tables feel very nostalgic. I haven't explored a \""lot\"" of the menu yet...because it's a LOT of menu! But everything I've had so far has been very good! I've had burgers on a couple of occasions (seriously - these are GOOD, fresh, not-pre-fab burgers), and the Reuben burger is my favorite! When they say you won't leave hungry...you WON'T leave hungry!!! I've also had the shrimp po' boy and it was hot, fresh and the avocado and lime mayo MADE the sammich!!! And I stopped by one night with a friend and we shared a spicy beef quesadilla and two French onion soups! Warm, filling and happy-making! The place can get PACKED, especially when the car stuff is going on out back - but service is always good. If they're a little slow or make a mistake, they're very quick to apologize and give an incentive to come back next time! I know that I can take adventurous or (even more challenging) non-adventurous eaters to Phil's and everybody is going to leave happy! And I look forward to exploring more of the menu!	1
I've been here a couple of times and have always had a good experience.  The place was clean with a nice outdoor area.  I was there for football Saturday this past weekend, and the service was very good.  I would give five stars, except that the person with me didn't love their sandwich.  I liked my food though!  I will definitely visit the Tempe Bar again.	1
Pretty good dining experience.  I had the horse tartare.  But I preferred Garde Manger!	1
Waren heute dort mit unseren beiden Kindern fr\u00fchst\u00fccken. Netter kleiner Laden mit nur 6 Tischen, hatten zum Gl\u00fcck reserviert. Keine Riesenauswahl (und schade dass es keine Desserts gibt), aber sehr lecker! Die hei\u00dfe Schokolade mit Chili kann ich sehr empfehlen. Hauptspeisen (wir hatten die Empanadas probiert, lecker) waren um 11 Uhr auch schon gro\u00dfteils verf\u00fcgbar. Gleich noch ein paar Sachen aus dem kleinen Shop mitgenommen.\n\nEndlich mal was vern\u00fcnftiges dank Gutscheinbuch (Schlemmerblock) gefunden, wo wir auch ohne Gutschein wieder hingehen w\u00fcrden.	1
We came here about 3 weeks ago and had Dim Sum.  My family recommended this place to have lunch.  Being chinese and a frequent explorer, I have had my fair share of dim sum.  This place was actually pretty decent.  I enjoyed some of the items here. Some more than others.  I wasn't expecting much since we were in Vegas, but this place did a great job.  Service was great as well.  I must say they make an awesome gai mei bao. The only thing is this place was pretty pricy.  In Los Angeles, you can get some great dim sum for $1 an item!	1
My fiance has been talking about this place for the last few months. He regularly frequents this place for lunch with his co-workers and has been waiting for the day that I got to try it too. Well, the day came when he brought a pizza from Corleone's home for dinner. Short story is that I LOVED the pizza so much that I demolished 3 whole slices - and their slices are not small. \n\nI have yet to try their sandwiches which seem to be their specialty but the fiance loves them and he was right about the pizza so I'm sure I'll be happy once I get my chance to taste test.	1
Really great massage. I was gifted a certificate for an hour deep tissue massage over the summer, and had held off on using it until after the holidays. Scheduling an appointment was easy since the masseuse, Lisa, has her own office; however, the internet scheduling is defunct, so be sure to call instead. Despite arriving seven minutes late (I thought the office was located up the street from me, but it's located way on the west side of town around Tenaya and Buffalo, near Summerlin- my bad) Lisa took her time. I mean REALLY took her time. My massage began around 3:00pm and Lisa worked on me, despite charging me for only an hour, until 5:00pm. I've had a lot of massages, and Lisa's style was particularly skillful and caring. She likes to make a little bit of small talk while working, which I didn't mind. She also used this new pressurized heating thing on my back, I can't remember what it was called but it felt amazing. Overall, I would recommend her to anyone looking for a quality, inexpensive, non-hotel massage.	1
Best value sushi place in th valley. Good rolls and variety.	1
