Where do I begin??? \nThis place is simply not good! We ordered a surf and turf to share that came with soup, salad and veggies. This was 39.99 plus a share charge. They ask if you want fried rice or white rice, and they don't let you know that they are going to up charge if you choose the fried rice. The rice was unbelievably salty, the steak tasted like New York steak versus the filet mignon it was supposed to come with. The lobster looked as though they bought langostino lobster in bulk at Costco. We ordered two appetizers, shrimp tempura and fried scallops. The tempura was nothing special, 5 stringy pieces of tempura mostly bread about a quarter of it shrimp. I think the only thing worthwhile was the fried scallops, those were good. We ordered two bowls for the kids one chicken and one steak, let's just say your better going to teriyaki madness for 8.95 you get a teriyaki bowl filled with meat rice and vegetables. Our waitress was nice as was the young hostess, aside from that I'd have to say this is the worst place to have hibachi in town. Our total bill was 116.00 WITHOUT alcoholic beverages, and we left still feeling hungry.	0
OMG...do not get scammed into this horrible experience....dinner for 2 buy one get one is a complete hoax!!!! Waiter didn't care...even was rude and charged us 63 dollars instead of 32 dollars...husband is sick and has been going to bathroom all day...he ate the calamari that we think was bad because me and my daughter didn't eat that....we love Braziliian Steak houses...i.e. Texas De brazil,,and others here in Vegas...but this one was something else and by that I mean HORRIBLE.....	0
Ok, so I've never been a fan of Domino's in the past and I can't say much has changed since they said they had redone their recipe for a \""better\"" pizza. The crust is just too overly seasoned. That really turns me off. It tastes like they put way too much garlic powder combined with Mrs. Dash on it, ew.\n\nThe texture is ok, but it's really not doing it for me. I prefer Pizza Hut or Papa John's still if I'm going for a cheap pizza on the quick.	0
Visit Date:  10/4/14\n\nThis. Is slowly getting worse. .. today strike 2.  Last week was not good, today the same. Eggs over cooked, potatos burnt. Quality is dropping.  I'll give this 1 more chance.	0
It's a cute place from the outside, VERY small inside, and the food is really mediocre.  The hamburgers were barely edible and the fries weren't even as good as McDonald's.  The servers were nice but I won't go here again.	0
It's Friday afternoon 2:45 pm you'd think the drive thru would be quicker than the last time I was in it (on a Sat 22min), nope 10 minutes. 2cars ahead of me. I'm not ever coming back to this one. What a joke.	0
When my friend and I were walking in, he noted that he didn't fully understand why there would be a restaurant named \""Twin Peaks\"". By the time we were seated, it became immediately clear that the title had nothing to do with actual mountains or the great outdoors. The service was friendly and pleasant, though the server did ask me \""What does hoppy mean?\"" when I asked her what the hoppiest beer on tap was. The food isn't great, and the beer taps are average. The BBQ Pulled Pork Nachos were something fiercely awful - Guy Fieri is probably kicking himself that he doesn't have it featured in his restaurants. To their credit, there are tons of televisions around to watch whatever sports are on (yippee).\n\nUltimately, the selling points for this place are the massive amounts of televisions and the scenery that only a heterosexual male with no greater sense of appetite can enjoy. The service seemed friendly enough, but the food was bleh.	0
I had just received a coupon from Starbuck's for $10 off a $30 purchase at Teavana, so I decided to buy some tea for my husband as a present. (The tea at Teavana is good but really expensive, so we definitely consider it an indulgence.) I get to the store (3pm, 5/23/2013), and I'm checking out the samples outside the store when a saleswoman comes up to me and starts telling me all about the teas. She was very salesy, spoke in an overly aggressive  tone, and couldn't read that I wanted some space to check things out on my own, but whatever - I realized that she was trying to do her job. But then she kept getting under my feet and butting in after I told her that I just wanted to look around. At the counter she shooed another employee away when it was my turn, which definitely made me feel like she's working on commission. She then proceeded to try to up-sell me on everything. She automatically put my purchase in the $7 containers rather than letting me know that she could have put them in regular bags. She measured out 2.5 oz instead of the 2.0 that I originally asked for (though, to be fair, she asked if that was ok & I said yes), and when I asked her to put my tea into bags instead of the canisters, she (very loudly) tried to make me feel cheap by announcing that \""you're already saving $10.\"" Other customers turned around and looked when she said this. I don't like being made to feel like I'm not spending enough when I just blew $35 on TEA, after the discount. The name on receipt says her name is Stephanie, though I don't know if that's right. There was another gal there who had helped me out the last time I was there, and she was FANTASTIC. She took time, answered my questions, and wasn't pushy. I wish she hadn't already been busy helping someone else; it would have been a completely different experience. As it was, I walked away feeling lousy that I had just spent so much money instead of feeling excited to surprise my husband.	0
This is a review of the wings; there are a lot of other items on the menu to try.  I got the 8 wings/fries combo plate and a Coke for about $10.  I found the wings tough and dry, even with the sweet BBQ sauce.  A much better alternative is The Chicken Shack (and I intend on visiting Buffalo Wild Wings soon).  The sad part is that it was completely empty on a Saturday afternoon (probably in part because there was no A/C), and everybody kept passing this place up in favor of Teriyaki Madness, right next door.  I think the reason for the poor business is the location...it's tucked away in the corner of a shopping center where the main attraction is a 24-Hour Fitness...obviously those types of people aren't going to get their jollies throwing away all their hard work on chicken wings.  Oh well.	0
I'm not just hating because of the skimpy outfits (that most of the women don't have the body to pull off)...the food's just bad. I was excited to see something go in where Earl's was because it has a great outdoor space (even though it's right off the freeway) and went shortly after they opened, but was quite underwhelmed. I have heard they have a great TV set up to watch football games though.	0
Had the combo plate.  Three out of four meats were dry/overcooked.  Last time, I had pulled turkey, so dry nearly inedible.  This can't be the best bbq around...	0
Do not move here!!! Have been a tenant for to long,  things to expect: drugs, shootings, robberies, killings 2 within 4 years with one happening 2 doors away. Harassment from the always changing property management, property poorly kept do not expect to get anything fixed in a timely  manner.DO NOT BRING FAMILY HERE THEY HATE KIDS! !!!	0
This place is the worst restaurant in Vegas. Services, food, and dinning area are failed. I was surprised that  Health Dept shut it down SO LATE in July 2014.\n\nMy family was dinning there few times and the foods and services are getting worse and worse. I speak their language and hear they bad month their customers, who obviously dont understand Chinese. Services is the worst part, i have to go to their stations to get my tea cups after i asked for assistance about missing tea cups from our table. It took me few minutes to find 2 clean cups! \n\nYes, they serve dim sum all day, BIG DEAL! Those dim sum will stay in the carts until they are sold. The heat in those carts are weak, go figure how fresh they are.\nBe careful what they charge u on the check! We found couple times they over charged us on what we did not order.\n\nWe are going dim sum somewhere else nowadays. We will never return to this place unless it has a new owner. This will happen really soon. Mark my word!	0
My review is not intended for the rooms but only the establishment. \nTHIS IS NOT HANDICAPPED FRIENDLY.  \nI went there today for Happy Hour.  When I pulled up to the front entrance I asked about where the handicapped parking was as I did not see any close by.  The directed me to a lot which was far off the beaten path.  I again drove up to the front and proceeded to park nearby where I saw other cars parked.  I was immediately told that I could not park there.  I told them that their handicapped lot was too far for any handicapped person to walk.  They said I could leave the car there but only if I gave them my keys.  I do not give anyone myt car keys.  They called the manager who said he could arrange for someone to follow me to the handicapped lot and bring me back.\nMy other complaint is that when I tried to get back into the restaurant from the patio the doors are too heavy and no button for handicapped to push to open the doors.\nI would not recommend this place for people who are handicapped or even people who have a problem with walking or who are not strength builders.  You need to be physically fit to stay here.	0
So we were looking for something different in Tempe. Well, we found it. So far the worst Italian I've had in the valley. Look at my stats. One star reviews are rare for me. I'll usually go back at least once to give them another chance. But I'll make an exception in this case, because there's no way I'm ever goin' back to this place.\n\nShould have known something was up when the waitress brought our drinks over talking on a cordless phone. \""No,\"" she said. \""I can't talk right now. No. I'm working. I'm kind of bringing someone their drinks. Can I call you back? I'll call you back. Bye.\"" When she put the phone down we ordered the eggplant parmesan. Big mistake. Looked and tasted like someone hid it at the bottom of the deep fryer and forgot about it. For 3 days. There wasn't much eggplant left, and what eggplant was left didn't taste much like eggplant. More like... cardboard. mmmm... cardboard parmesan. Seriously, it was gross. Sad thing was we were absolutely starving and on our way to a show so we ate it. Well, most of it. It came with a side of spaghetti, which was all right. Not as gross as the eggplant, but still not good.\n\nThought I'd give them a chance to redeem themselves with a canoli for dessert. Worst canoli ever. The dough was hard and stale, and the filling was strangely sour and so thick that technically I don't think it could be classified as cream. More like... gel.\n\nBad service, bad food. Beware.	0
Not only can't they get the order correct, they can't put everything in the bag that I paid for.\nI'm never comming back you brainless morons.\nFYA.	0
Delicious food- friend pickles are to die for- \n\nAwesome bartenders and cocktails \n\n\nMust try their Monday Night Cap! With $5 snacks and awesome drink specials!	1
How strange to read the bad reviews. I am picky and thought my sandwich was delish and wonderful. The service was excellent. One of the owners was there and he was delightful to talk too. Hmmmmm, not sure how it stacks up to an authentic steak from Philly since I have never been there to have one but I know who to send to find out. I think Wiz is gross so I had the regular Roast Beef sandwich with provolone, onions and banana peppers and it was great! Their sweet potato fries were good too. They are also open 24/7 which is amazing in itself. Check it out. Maybe the after bar crowd suffers. I don't know but it was fine when we went on Black Friday. It was not busy nor rude. We had a Groupon so even better.	1
Sehr guter Italiener!! \nDie Pizza wird mitten im Restaurant vor den Augen der G\u00e4ste zubereitet und ist super lecker. Der Service ist gut und die Preise angemessen.\nEinziger Kritikpunkt: Tische und St\u00fchle im Freien h\u00e4tten vor dem Essen abgeputzt werden k\u00f6nnen. Deswegen \""nur\"" 4 von 5 Sternen	1
Having just moved from Seattle to Glendale AZ 4 months ago, I needed to find someone who cleaned carpets. I asked a few people who are locals to the area.\n\nI had Leo's Carpet Cleaning  out to my home after seeing reviews of others on Facebook who have used Leo's Carpet Cleaning. I emailed Leo on Monday and got quote by phone. Leo charges by size of home.\n\n I'm in a single story home and given a quote of $125. Two Story is $225. I scheduled an appoint for Thursday (today) . Leo showed up on time ( which I appreciate since I work from home). He did not rush the job, in fact he was here 2 hours. Leo really cares about his work and it showed in his hard work. Leo has a helper who is also great and just as attentive as Leo to detail.\n\nA  great job, my carpet are off white and left in great shape. I couldn't be any more happier! I will call on this company for regular service from here on.	1
A great place to catch a sporting event and have a drink. It was a clean well organized place. The service was really good. The chicken zingers and sliders came out quick and hot. Too bad they dont have any locations in cali.	1
Yelp 100 Challenge: 32/100\n\n26 postures. 90 minutes. 105\u00b0 room at 40% humidity. Prepare to sweat like a pig! The heat is intense.There will be times during class when you'll be wondering why you're doing this to yourself. You might even question your own sanity.\n\n This is what was bouncing around my head on my first class back....\n\nWhat's wrong with me? Why am I doing this again?\nI'm crazy. I've literally lost my mind.\nEwwww.. I'm still sweating.\nI'm going to pass out. \nWhy can't I bend like that? \nWater! Water! Water!\nI'm going to do this again tomorrow?!\n\nMake no mistake about it-- Bikram will be one of the most intense workouts you will ever do. It will also be one of the most rewarding things you will ever do. This is why I keep coming back for more. \n\nI've hopped around to various 'hot yoga' studios in the Vegas area. What I've learned is that the right instructor can make all the difference in the world. I am happy to report that every instructor I've had has been very supportive, motivating, and uplifiting. They go out of thier way to make sure sure everyone feels welcomed and even make a point to learn your name.  \n\nThe studio is gorgeous. It's squeaky clean and updated with Flotex Eco-Carpet. Why is that awesome? This is the ONLY studio that doesn't have the 'Funky Bikram Smell' that I've experienced at other studios. Yep, you heard that right. NO. FUNKY. SMELLS. Yippee! \n\nTheir locker room is clean and modern. No need to bring a padlock to class. You can easily program your own code and your personal items are easily secured in your choice of lockers. They also provide toiletry items if you prefer to shower and primp on-site.\n\nHands down, this is my favorite place for Bikram. I'm a loyal customer and will contunue my Bikram journey at this studio. If you're looking to give it a whril, come here.  When you're ready to check this place out, I highly suggest visiting their website to view their new student tips so you can properly prepare. \n\nNamaste.	1
Went back the next day with my son and mom and the fries were still specatular.  This time I had a stromboli and it was pretty good.	1
My daughter loves this store with that much Hello Kitty going on it's a three year old girls dream. The prices are a little hard to figure out some things are really good deals and some are just overpriced. The owner knows us when we come in now and they are all really friendly. The nice bonus is they are open fairly late. This is also a great place for last minute gifts on the way to kid B-day partys.	1
Only thing missing is a pool. Also the track iirc is 1/8th miles, so it takes a LOT of laps to get any real jogging in. Other than that this place is great.	1
This is my local hang out for breakfast. I am here all the time and each time it is always great. I have lived for quite sometime and have eaten quite a few breakfasts in all sorts of areas. This is probably the place the reminds me best of traditions.\n\nA good french toast is such a treat in this day and age that I especially appreciate the greatness of such a restaurant.\n\nI miss the butter milk pancakes as much as anyone but you can't have everything alll the time. There are certain compromises that need to be made.	1
It's been tough for me the past few years, being a laser tag fan in the Henderson area. Ultrazone and Laser Force are gone. For years, the only options have been to drive across town to Laser Quest or the Adventure Dome, and neither one of them are terribly great experiences. When I heard a new laser tag place was opening close to home, I was pretty damn pleased, albeit skeptical.\n\nI finally went over and tried this place to day, and I have something to say:\n\nLaser tag is BACK. And in a big way.\n\nThe laser tag here is from the Laser Force company, which is the same company that ran the standalone Laser Force outlet at Sunset/Pecos for several years before it finally shut down. It's largely the same experience - the equipment is easy to use, and the venue is a good size and has plenty of surprises. Granted, the arena isn't as big as that of their standalone venue of the past, but this is still a respectable place to play laser tag, and it definitely trumps the other places remaining in the city. I'll be returning here, and often. The experience is a whole lot of fun, easy to learn but tough to master. Plus, it's fun for all ages.\n\nThe mini golf course is solid, though not the best of its kind - although I guess I kind of have been spoiled by the KISS mini golf course that opened up a few months back. All things considered though, it's cool to finally have a blacklit indoor mini golf course in the Henderson area - and it's still a lot of fun to experience.\n\nThere is also an arcade, which includes games of change you can earn tickets at to get prizes. However, the selection of games is not that great and the prize selection is pretty basic. I would like to see more arcade games in here in the future, preferably some classics. Still, the arcade is a \""side show\"" next to the laser tag and mini golf, so I can't knock points off for this.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that they do have some food available, including pizza, which is nice if you get hungry during your laser tag marathon. The staff are all very friendly and were helpful with any questions I had.\n\nOverall this place comes strongly recommended, any shortcomings are minor.	1
I love the ambiance of this place. We dined on a comfortable, leather sofa in the cozy cellar downstairs. It was candle lit, intimate, and had good mood music playing. It would be a wonderful place to bring a date you would like to impress! We had a bottle of Shiraz wine, mushroom toasts, sliders, tortilla crusted halibut, and some creme brule. Everything was delicious & our server was very knowledgeable. We will DEFINITELY be back!	1
My wife and I visit Vegas at least once a year.  Until I found this place (and others) on Yelp, we used to just have breakfast/brunch in the hotel's anonymous coffee shop.  Meh.\n\n Now that Yelp has opened my eyes, we've tried different places.  The Egg & I is one of our favorites for breakfast (actually brunch since we don't leave the hotel until 10 a.m. or so).  We eat here most often because there is a plethora of different items on their menu to choose from and they are ALL GOOD!  Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat when I'm away from home, so this is important to me.\n\nTo be honest it is pretty difficult to screw up a basic breakfast centered on eggs and breakfast meat.  However, the Egg & I is head and shoulders above the others with various delicious potato and egg treatments, their muffins, and friendly service staff.  Needless to say, we don't eat in hotel coffee shops anymore.  Not only do you get huge quantities of food at the Egg & I, it all tastes great, and what a variety!  If you're not into eggs, they also have waffles, pancakes and french toast, as well as salads and sandwiches.  Also free wifi so you can catch up on news from home & messages while eating.\n\nIf you are like my wife and insist on staying in a big-name Strip resort hotel, do yourself a favor and drive a short distance off the strip to have breakfast and some really tasty food.  Catch a glimpse of what the rest of the City of Las Vegas looks like, and taste real food, not the bland stuff the corporate chains dish out.  You might realize, like I did, that The Strip is not the final destination of your trip to Vegas.\n\nThere are fine dinner restaurants off the Strip as well!  Yelp is here for you.	1
Probably one of my favorite fast food burger joints. Everyone knows about the Animal Style, but it's never on the menu. The burger is great, but the fries are below average (without animal style). The first few bites makes me feel like I'm in heaven, but it gets old pretty quick. Maybe it's just too much sauce. I don't know.\n\nThe concept gets 5 stars, but I'm only going to give it 4 stars. The biggest issue for me is the wait. I've waited as long as 45 minutes before. I think this family owned business can use an efficiency lesson from McDonald's or Chipotle or Jimmy Johns. Ridiculous! Did they just kill the cow after I made my order?	1
So my boyfriend and I come here alllll the time. It is a little hole in the wall but a hidden jem. I am a total dive bar girl and love love that it is right off the strip! We are pretty new to the Las Vegas area and I was nervous to go in at first but drove by many times and was wanting to check it out. I just didnt want to walk in and there be only regulars...it wasn't like that at all like that considering it is soo close to the strip..duh Crystal! So $1 beers is where I will start..helll yes! They have some cheap bar food too, I have only tried the dogs... you get a hot dog and Bud for $2.50, we go for the brat and Amber for $3.00. $3.00 shots of Crown is just flat out awesome, I am not into Patron but they do shots for $4 and I know that is a steal! We are talking real shots too, not half a shot. All the lady bartenders are great and the bouncers are really nice and keep all the creeps away if need-be. Have the brunett bartender make you a vegas bomb she her style...holy YUM and STIFF...thats my kind of fruity shot! \nThe ONLY reason I give it 4 stars instead of  5 is because there is no small dancing area to dance to their great music pumping out of the junk box...My friend was dancing around and was told to stop so that is lame but I do understand it is not a place for dancing too. \nAnyways you should definitley check it out! We take all our friends that come into town there for pre-gaming before going out..you just cant go wrong.	1
Put your dinner in their hands!!\n\nBest nobu meal i have ever had. We just asked them to bring out dish after dish after dish for our group of 12 without ordering from the menu.  Every dish was spot on and better than the last.  Delicious rare ingredients from parts unknown.  Awesome service, awesome drinks.  One of the best meals i have ever had anywhere.  Expensive but amazing.	1
