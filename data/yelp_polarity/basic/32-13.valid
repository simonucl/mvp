Paid $1200+ for a table, we were outside with 20 mph winds and too cold for girls in dresses. They wouldn't move us. Awful customer service. Staff was sympathetic but ultimately unhelpful.	0
One of those restaurants where you go in, and go \""huh, why is it sooo empty\"".  Albeit it's a Wed nght, but it's also Restaurant Week... I even felt like we owned the entry area of the Theodore.. never saw a soul except a desk guy hidden in an alcove.  Park in the adjacent Buckboard lot, as there was a sign stating Guest Parking $10 though I didn't see an attendant who could collect.\n\n4 people, all a variety of dishes from the very promising sounding menu so we definitely had the works.  It just did not wow.  I appreciated the papardelle pasta was freshly made (but kept tossing overboard to my bf the mushy bland short rib meat... mid week leftovers?) and the meyer lemon tart.  General repeated comment re: our mains... salty.\n\nNow I can see this being a place for lounging and drinks, especially if they were to draw those curtains down around you to cozy up your table.  But I want to like the food too.	0
I am officially not a fan. I went here tonight with some friends to see Tangled. We get stopped at the door and they ask to search my bag. First off, searching bags of customers have gotten a LOT of theaters in trouble, even sued. THESE SEARCHES ARE ILLEGAL. It's called privacy invasion. So good job there. Secondly, even if I am carrying snacks (which I was - let's be honest, those prices are extortionate even for a \""dollar\"" theater and there's not too many vegan goods) I was still going to buy popcorn - that story will come in a moment. Debate about the ethical reasoning of bringing in snacks all you want, but I don't want anyone searching my private property unless they are actual security or police. \n\nSo we take our snacks back to the car and go into the theater. My friends go to find a seat, and I stand in line for some popcorn. Note that there are no signs saying CASH ONLY anywhere. (NOTE: my friend paid for the movie so I didn't notice at the box office if signs were there or not.) When I finally get to the counter after 7 minutes of waiting (seriously the staff was working like they were underwater) I am told they don't take cards, but I can go to the ATM off to the side. Are you freakin' serious?! Why the hell would I go to an ATM when all I want is a small popcorn? There should be signage so I didn't have to waste my damn time. This subsequently put me in an awful mood for the rest of the time I was there. \n\nAs for the theater - when they shut off the lights you can't see a thing. It took me 2 minutes to find my friends. The sound quality of the movie was not great and I could hear every single person munching on popcorn and slurping drinks. So not enjoyable. Kids running around screaming and crying as well - overall a complete disaster. \n\nTreating your customers as criminals is not okay in my book, and I can assure you I will not be back here - I would rather pay the extra dough for stadium seating, debit card acceptance, and not having my bag searched (it wasn't even a big bag!). And that's saying a lot from someone who likes spending her money on shoes. Shame on you, Tropicana Cinemas.	0
I'm pissed.  Surprised...and pissed.  What the hell happened to Orange Table!?  My boyfriend and I stopped for breakfast on Sunday and experienced the worst service I think that I have had anywhere!\n\nWe ordered breakfast.  After waiting 25 minutes (for eggs, people...eggs...this is not a big deal), I went inside (because the waiter was not conscientious enough to come to us) to ask if there was a problem with our order.  The response was, and I quote, \""The kitchen is backed up; it should be out in a few minutes.\""  Note: there was no apology for the wait, and no effort to appease me.\n\nAfter waiting another 10 minutes, a waitress came by and asked generally if we were having a good day.  When we said that we would feel better about our day if we were able to get our food, the response was, and I quote: \""Haven't you ever been here on the weekend.  We are always slow on the weekend.\""  Are you friggin' kidding me!!!?  This is an appropriate response!?  Again, no apology.  No offer of coffee or roll or something while we wait.  And is slow service EVER an acceptable policy!?\n\nA few more minutes went by; my boyfriend and I stood up to leave just as our food was coming.  We even said to the waiter, \""We were just going to leave.\""  No response.  None!  Couldn't friggin' believe it.\n\nI used to tell everyone about this place.  No more.	0
I ordered a carne asada burrito and a beef taco here around 3pm on a weekday. The beef taco was pretty good, the cheese was fresh and the lettuce tasted clean. \n\nHowever, the carne asada burrito was not good, I tried covering it up with salsa,  still not good. The steak was burnt looking, maybe it had been sitting for awhile. I don't recommend the steak for anything.\n\nThe new breakfast burrito is tasty as long as they do not burn the eggs. This place is hit or miss.	0
Ordered a whiskey river bbq burger medium well, got served a patty that was cooked fine on one side but the other was charred to the point it was inedible due to the taste. The bottomless fries were thin, hard and almost stale...this is out of the norm as a year ago this place was actually pretty good, not now. With smash burger down the street there's no point to come here, especially due to their policy of no legal firearms on their premises.  Guess they don't realize signage holds no weight in Nevada and they must think criminals won't walk past that sign.  Their loss five guys or smash burger it is.	0
I'm sorry to say that I am not a fan. I was so wishing for something to write home (or Yelp) about, but I walked away disappointed. The place was really not in good condition. The chairs were broken and the vinyl was torn on them. The table was sticky (THAT\""S THE WORST!), the staff were not friendly, and the food was only mediocre. Gosh I really wanted to like it!\n\nOne thing is that the seating area was so small that I was always feeling in the way and I couldn't relax and just eat. The tables are very close and some ladies were seated next to us and it felt like they were actually AT my table. That wouldn't be a big deal if they were nice people. They were very loud and speaking in a language that was not my own. They only would steal a few looks at us when they thought we weren't looking. It is natural to think that the people are talking about you, right? That's how I felt for some reason.\n\nAvoid this place if possible. There are other places nearby that are better. Pho Kim Long for instance.	0
Geisha A No No. That's its real name. Didn't you know? \n\nContrary to what the Phx News Times said in an online review, this place does not open for lunch. Imagine our disappointment, for a trio of hungry co-workers had been planning a lunch escape to this location for quite some time. (What can we say except domo arigato, mr. roboto.)\n\nUhm, the door was unlocked, though. Just as we began to pull it open, thinking they had just opened for lunch, a man in a gray t-shirt approached. \n\n\""Hey, we're not open.\"" \n\""We read an online review that you were open for lunch.\""\n\""Nope. We've never been open for lunch.\""\n\""Oh...\""\n\""Come back for happy hour. We open every day at 5.\""\nMy co-worker checked his watch. \""That's only 5 hours from now. Thanks.\""\n\nAnd then he walked off. No \""thank you.\"" No \""let me tell you about your other options in the area.\"" Nothing. He just walked toward the back of the business. Must be the owner or manager. I would think that if patrons (attempted ones at that) were trying to check out your place, you'd at least paste on a smile, stop to tell them about the area and welcome them back for dinner, with a complimentary app. But nope. \n\nBelieve me, I've seen their HH menu and it sucks. Tempura everything. Sure, load me up on fried foods. Of course the interior is pleasing. I love the idea of green walls. But I will not be coming back here. \n\nI don't know how they stay in business. They must offer other \""services\"" behind closed curtains in their private rooms.	0
review of the time share presentation only since we didn't stay there.\n\nwe took a bus from luxor to go to this time share presentation from the lure of $100 in gaming chips. WOO! we had nothing better to do so we hopped on the bus and it took forever to get to this place. close to the strip MY ASS. i wondered that if i did end up buying the time share with my imaginary money, i'd definitely need a car to get to the strip and back.\n\nanyway, we get to the time share presentation and the three of us get barbie girl as our salesperson. we told her right away we were there for the gaming chips and she said she needed to pitch us anyway. she told us all this mumbo jumbo and gave us a tour of the facilities. pretty cool but it's so effing far from the strip and you can stay at hotel condos on the strip or close to it like the MGM signature. why would you stay here? the furniture and kitchen are were nice and big and i remember seeing a bath tub in a random part of the room. the sex room. hahaha.\n\nanyway after the tour she comes back and gives us a free lunch which was supposed to be \""amazing\"" but it was nasty. i could have crapped out a better lunch blind. plus the cookies were stale and the coffee was nasty. blech. \n\nshe gave her pitch we said no, she walked back and forth and gave us lower and lower deals and we said no. she said thanks and we go to another room with another man who looked like his job was to close deals we said no. he gave us a ridiculous deal that was way below what the other lady gave us. uh.... so is that what it's really worth? we said no. \n\nthen we go to another guy who has the \""chips\"" and he tries again but not as hard and we say no and give us our chips. he finally gives it to us and we go back to luxor and we realize the chips were the ones that we had to turn into real chips so we couldn't just cash it out. we play until we can turn them into real chips, cash it out, and leave, 5-6 hours later.\n\nI still talk about this experience to friends and it's a funny convo starter so for that i give it one more star. one star for the cash. zero stars for the food and sales pitch. blech.	0
Rain prevented us from golfing one day, so the four of us decided to get something to eat.  Heard there were some good Chinese restaurants in Chandler and didn't have a specific place in mind.  Just drove and happened on Sun Chinese.  My husband and I are Chinese so we know Chinese food and this was not it.  Not until reading the other reviews did we realize it was a \""Korean Chinese\"" restaurant.  Never heard of such a thing.  Maybe they do Korean well, but the \""Chinese\"" food we order was not good.  The waitress first brought out a small portion of  fried won ton strips w/ a sweet and sour sauce for dipping that were greasy and tasted like they had been sitting around for days. Hot and sour soup had way too much cornstarch.  Other main dishes also weren't that great and some of it was just strange.	0
Hadn't been here since they changed from Fado's, but I stopped in at happy hour for a friend's birthday. The appetizers were very good but here's the kicker...\n\n$9.73 for a tall Guinness... at happy hour? Who am I, Donald Trump?\n\nI'm sure I'll go here again, possibly for dinner... but I dont know who named it Happy Hour.	0
What do you get when an iconic NYC bar opens a second location in Las Vegas? Well, does it have a loud mouthy bitch in a low cut top serving drinks? Check. How about the big, fat doorman w/ bald head, leather vest and a long beard? Check. Will you hear \""Slowride\"" played at a mind numbing volume? Check Again!!!\n\nSo, what's the problem here? Maybe it's just the pretentious forced feeling that this place wants the reputation it didn't establish. Cool dive bars aren't chains. I don't think any of us think Applebee's when we tell people about our favorite neighborhood restaurant, but for the most part that's exactly what the Las Vegas H&H is. Sure it's got the look, the sound, plenty bikes and bad ass cars parked out front and no shortage of people playing the part, but it feels more like a production rather than a well earned atmosphere.\n\nI wanted to like this place, we've stopped there 3X but w/ so many bars in the Downtown area opening that aren't replicas of another location, you'll be like most and soon find a watering hole that better suits your taste. As one that spends a lot of time in Downtown, I'd say you'd never kick yourself for missing this place; but, if interest gets the better of you, you can always do what we saw most doing last time we visited: buy a drink, watch the bar theatre and pick up some Tchotchke to bring back to wherever your from to say you went.	0
Dumbbells everywhere. Not labeled. Smells a lil funky. It is a nice gym but just not maintained very well.	0
I've experienced much better.   I love food, I just LOVE LOVE LOVE me some food.  The food here is... meh.   I've been three times, and my general reaction is 2-3 stars at best for each of my visits.  Hey, can I get that without the green chilis?  No?  What about... can I get this with the sauce on the side?  No?  Can I...? Never mind, she just WALKED AWAY.\n\nAfter three visits with these folks, I have had a 100% consistent issue with getting seated- and this place actually earned its own tweet (I rarely tweet) because of the consistently snippy, unhelpful, and downright stand-offish response when we try to come spend our $400 there for a group lunch. So... two stars for consistency... that does seem to indicate a \""policy\"" and hooray for you, to be able to maintain such a strict adherence to your policies.  I guess. \n\nIt's unfortunate that there's one person on our admin staff that just ADORES this disaster of a chain, thus we end up getting dragged here for their annual \""work anniversary\"" lunch celebration.  No amount of calling ahead to see what can be done to make things go more smoothly for the staff at Oregano's (why wouldn't you want to know that a party of 15 is on its way?) and I've long since given up on trying to make things go smoothly for our staff.    I know you don't take reservations, I'm not trying to break your rules... I'm calling with a head's up to let you know that we have a group coming in 2 days from now.  And when I call ahead as they open that day to let them know, and I get the same defensive reaction.  Again, not trying to break your rules.  Just trying to see what CAN be done- but thank you for the thorough scolding on all of the things that CAN'T be done.\n\nThe rule here -*******take note if you're going to be with a group******- is that they WILL NOT SEAT YOU unless every member of your party is there.  That last person who stayed behind to lock the door and then caught the red light?  No, no, we can't seat the other 14 of you, that last, 15th, person has to be here before you can have your table.\n\nI've experienced this at the Chandler location once, in 2011... as well as the Gilbert location twice (once in 2012 and once in December of 2013).  \n\nWhen I was a kid (oh yes, I went there), there was a place in Phoenix called Ed Debevicks (I believe)... it was a 50's New York diner-style experience, complete with waiters and waitresses that would strive to exceed each other in the ways that they could be outrageously, hilariously, rude.  They'd shove you over so they could sit down while they took your order.  They'd loudly chew gum and take a sip of your drink.  They might call you names, they'd for sure snort and roll their eyes, but at the end of the day it was all a joke.  As they were putting on the act, they were covertly on the BALL with your order, with a new drink and refills, with getting your order correct and hot and on your table quickly.  \n\nOreganos?  Well... they're rude.  Aaaand... that's it.\n\nGood for groups: No\nGood when you need to catch a movie: No\nGood for work lunch (you have to be done in a reasonable time frame): No\n\nI tried to order Alfredo the Dark with one modification:  Nope. Can't do it.  Okay, that's fair.\n\nI tried to order the Lady is a Scampi: our server said \""It's spicy and we won't take it back if it's too spicy\"".  Well, I like to put sriracha sauce on my pizza, and I order my wings \""Hot\"" wherever I go, but she was so severe, I was worried about dropping $15 and going hungry for the rest of my work day. \n\nI have ordered a Julius Cesar salad with chicken (huge), which was good, but I've had better.\n\nI have ordered the Zany Ziti, and found it unbearably bland.  And I do believe pasta and pizza is like sex... even when it isn't the BEST you've ever had... well, I'm not going to complain.   But... really, really BLAND.  I thought, like some pastas, that it just needed a day to sort of meld the flavors, so I looked forward to having it as a leftover the next day, but it came in a breadbowl, which then rendered it inedible as a leftover the next day. \n\nI've had the thin crust pizza, which was fine.  I mean... *straining to say something nice* ...yeah.  It was ...fine.\n\nSo, kids, as much as I struggle emotionally with leaving a 2-star review... that's been my experience after three visits - and next year for my co-worker's anniversary, I'll wish her well and then probably head up Gilbert Road to Joe's BBQ.	0
Been there 3 times in 2 days been treated horrible.  Pass on this place & how they operate.\n1- They refused to honor their $1 off coupon on 2 occasions, then refused another coupon after they made the sandwich they said was good.   Complete morons and horrible service and treatment.  They switch to spanish and knew they were being even more rude.	0
This was our third stop during our Sunday bar hopping schedule. Typically, I read up on the places near by as we munch an appetizer and savor a tasty beverage. On this occasion we skipped that formality as the previous bartender said that Kona had great food and cheap happy hour prices.\n\nWhen we arrived, we quickly found two seats at the outdoor bar. I will have to give them a nod for places to people watch. Across from us was a Wilem Dafoe look alike in a black wife beater. He kept muttering to himself (I secretly suspect that he was arguing with himself). A couple of seats down from him was a dude that was rockin the full beach dude hair...party on bra\n\nOk back to Kona, happy hour drinks were ok, and they were cheap ($5), but the ultra lounge bartenders seemed busier than necessary. We finally settle on a sushi roll for our obligatory app.\n\nNow sushi is one of those dishes that takes a great deal of finesse and precision. You are basically buying about A cup of rice and some uncooked tasties for wrap and filling. Our roll was a happy hour special, so $5 for what would normally cost $10.\n\nWhat we got was a sad mangled roll. The pieces were so poorly cut, from the side it looked like a cell phone add showing how many bars you can get in this area. The taste was ok, if a bit bland, and the serving temp was decidedly too warm for sushi.\n\nOk, bottom line here folks, stop buy Kona for happy hour drinks, watch the carnival of lost souls huddled around the bar, and skip the food.	0
Expensive. Not that good... And they've charged me twice for \""extra guacamole and sour cream\"" that I didn't ask for. That's $2.50 each time. Enough to be aggravating but not enough to drive back for. \n\nI won't be back.	0
I got the fried rice with beef, and it was so-so.  I've had better.  The restaurant was decent andthe staff was friendly and fast.  But the food was just ok, and I have to admit that while I was eating it I was a little worried if I would get sick or not.  \nBut to be fair the other people I was eating with loved their food.  I heard the tempura vegetables were great.  Unfortunatley my experience was just mediocre. Thats the way it goes though, but  I will give them another shot , roll with the punches and try a different dish.  I'll keep you posted.	0
Food was ok. But the service was TERRIBLE. Our waitress lied to us about what our order consisted of. Then when it came out it was of course wrong. When we tried to reorder it they told us the kitchen closed, but their closing time wasn't for another 2 hours. Plus they were still serving other guests! Next, they told us they could remake it, but it'd be very inconvenient for them, since there was no chef. Ok wait... This place has an OPEN kitchen. I can see the cooks!!! And they're cooking!! Anyway... They finally remade it right. But this service was no service at all. They might as well have told me to cook it myself. Assholes. The only reason they're getting 2 stars instead of 1 is because when it was finally made the right way it's wasn't terrible.	0
Went there because we heard the food was great. If possible, the food was worse than the service. Sketchy looking building on the outside. Got seated right away. Ten minutes later out server came by. No mild salsa, actually nothing mild to dip your chips in.... If you get chips that is. Got our first batch and had to flag down a bus boy for some more. We had about 6 different people come to the table, none of which came by a second time. FINALLY got our food after what felt like 30 minutes. We were hopeful that the food would make up for the terrible service but we were sadly disappointed. Dry chicken, cold burritos, bland beans. Took seriously 20 minutes to get our check. The ONLY thing good this place has going for it is strong margaritas. SADLY SADLY disappointed and will NOT come back.	0
Here are my gripes with Tofu Hut: \n\n-The side dishes look and taste as if they were made weeks in advance.\n-The meats have that brown/gooey look to them, as meats tend to do when they're old. \n-The customer service is lacking, although this is expected from an Asian establishment.\n-The restaurant is filthy, which probably indicates the cleanliness of the food you're consuming. \n\nThe positives are that its well priced for a buffet and the selection of meats are diverse. You can order cow tongue if your heart so desires.\n\nOverall, I'd rather pay $5 more to eat at a nicer/cleaner/fresher spot. My friends do enjoy eating here due to the price, so I'm sure I'll be suckered into coming back, but not because I want to. \n\nKorean Garden and DJK are better options, although more expensive.	0
My daughter and I went here for dinner to celebrate an occasion that only happens once in a lifetime, Retirement, for me of course. She told me to pick out any place that was different and unique. I searched high and low and behold, II Vinaio.\n\nMy daughter didn't sound too pleased of my choice because of her culinary skills and wide range of unique eating establishments but she agreed and we arrived at our reservation time. We could have got away without the reservation.\n\nOur server was very prompt and recited the specials without hesitation, we selected the assorted cheese plate and alligator sausage with some kind of fritter for starters.\nThe cheese platter had an assortment of 3 different cheeses,olives,fruit,nuts,and not enough small toasted bread slices to accommodate all the cheese. The alligator sausage was good but was it really alligator sausage? Not that I eat it all the time,so am I an expert on alligator ? but it was good if it was gator. And any type of batter that is thrown into hot oil is always tasty, the fritter.\n\nThe cheese platter was good because the cheese comes from outside vendors and placed on a plate with the proper condiments how can you go wrong,a no brainier here. \nMy dinner choice was Crispy Prime Pork Loin over fontina risotto and caper berry sauce.That was another disappointment in my life .I also have a large repertoire of fine foods and this was not it. The plating would not have won an academy for best picture because the pounded out paper thin panko crusted pork cutlet was place on top of the dollop size portion of risotto and ugh. \n\nOur server promptly asked us how was the food and I told her that the pictures posted on this site sure didn't look like what I ordered. She told me that those pictures were posted a long time ago and things have changed. Well honey, that's the reason I came here, the pictures of the food were amazing.\nI've eaten pork loin before, not only in restaurants but I also cook a mean pork roast myself. This was not it!!! All I tasted was panko bread crumbs, where's the pork??\n\nLong grain rice (risotto) with melted cheese, I've had better.\nMy daughter has some kind of salad, just an assortment of greens with venison, nothing special.\n\nThe two glasses of Bordeaux were alright but were they Bordeaux? \nMy daughter should have paid the bill with a picture of a credit card and II Vinaio should have a disclaimer posted on their front door that reads, What you see you may not get.	0
Let me start off by saying that the only reason I'm giving this place a 2 star is because the manager ended up comping our meal at the end.\n\nSo, let's start with \""the good\"". The look of the restaurant is spectacular. It looks Italian, and decor is intriguing (esp. the lights over each table). If Yelp was based on looks alone, the Strand would be a solid 5. Too bad for the Strand that this is not the case...\n\nNow for \""the bad\"". The bad outweighs the good like a boulder outweighs a crumb, so let me put this in list form.\n\n1.) The service: We entered this establishment with no prior knowledge of it, no bias. After taking a seat, the four of us ordered our meals shortly after. Another family entered the Strand approximately 10 minutes after us and were seated at the empty table next to us. Their food was served to them 10 minutes before ours made it out to us. One of the folks in our party very specifically ordered their dish without mushrooms. It was brought out with mushrooms. Some time passed before we spotted our server (or A server for that matter) and catching her to let her know of the mistake wasn't an easy feat. Finally, the dish was corrected, though it was brought out after everyone else had:  finished their plates. And although the rest of our dinners were less than desirable, we ate most it because we were all hungry and there were no servers around to bring this up to.\n\n2.) The food: The mushroom thing; okay, that's an honest mistake (though the time it took to correct it was not), but even when they brought out the plate for the 2nd time, the rice was undercooked and crunchy, and it lacked any flavor at all. Everyone at the table tried a bite to confirm this. The pasta another person at our table ordered was overcooked and soggy, while the pizza my wife and I ordered was burned to a crisp. Of course, we would have complained earlier on in our visit if the servers were actually around and didn't dart out of sight as soon as you spotted them. \n\n3.) The overall experience: Chef Ramsay would have a heyday with this place. Aside from the food that makes one wonder if the chef themselves have ever actually tasted it, and the absent servers, the manager himself didn't seem to understand what constructive criticism is. When he finally came out after requesting him twice, he didn't seem to like what we had to say and tried negating our complaints with the fact that three of the four of us had eaten most of what we'd ordered (after we'd explained the server situation). He asked for constructive criticism, to which we explained that every complaint we had actually was constructive as he could use it to improve upon his business (duh.) He threw his arms up frustrated and said, \""Fine, you're meals comped\"" before storming off. I felt bad for a few seconds and then I suddenly didn't anymore. The food sucked, the service was terrible, and because of the terrible service we reluctantly nibbled on the sucky food. I'd have felt violated if we would had to pay for that craptastic experience. \n\nThis place deserves a 1 star review, but because of the manager's decision to do the right thing at the end, I decided to be kinder to their overall rating. I hope that the manager used our constructive criticism to make dining at the Strand more pleasant for future customers.	0
Anxious to see this new addition and knowing it was being marketed as the largest in the US., my family went on the second day it was open.  Admission for 2 adults and 1 child came to $52 and change, which made it more expensive than other local attractions.  Overall, we enjoyed the experience but it was not worth the money, especially when both the Phoenix Zoo and Desert Botanical Garden are a 15 minute drive away, both are cheaper, larger, provide much more to see and do for a longer period of time, and DBG has it's own Spring Butterfly Exhibit.\n\nOur son enjoyed the 3D movie, and throughout our entire visit, was the most educational aspect provided - although it centered around Monarch butterflies and their migration only.  The Chrysalis Lab, which you visit next, was the highlight of the visit.  However, there was absolutely no information provided aside from the paper tags identifying the types of butterflies in each type of cocoon.  Because you visit this area directly after the movie and the entire theater is emptied directly into this room, you really only have the length of the next movie to enjoy yourself before being crowded in upon by the next incoming group.  Due to my family being at the back of our theater, by the time the room cleared out enough to give us a good view of the cocoons, we had about 5 minutes or so and then were swarmed by the next large group of people anxious to get a look and were crowded out.\n\nThe atrium itself was alright, but disappointing for what was being boasted about it.  It was hot and humid, as to be expected, and the vegetation has a lot of growing to do before it can even be considered as rainforest-y.  The butterfly guide provided when admission was paid was both lacking quite a few species which were spotted, and listed a handful which weren't identified anywhere.  Aside from the few guides answering questions for children and marking their punch cards (they received a prize at the end for having a completed punch card), there was absolutely no information, signage, etc. provided anywhere...which was disappointing.\n\nThe ant colony and bee exhibit were alright, but have potential to be much better.  There were a few native AZ species in a corner that looked like they were thrown in as an afterthought and were out of place.  The fish seemed as an odd addition, and were nothing spectacular.  All very common species of fish found at any chain pet store and in the center of the room was a touch tank with 4 very small stingray laying on the bottom of the pool.  Only one came up on occasion, and the moment it was touched, went straight back down to the bottom.  Not faulting the stingray and wanting to be left alone, but a lot more could be done with that exhibit if they want to make it memorable in any way.\n\nOverall, a once-a-year-if-that sort of place unless you REALLY like butterflies.  It was expensive, and didn't provide enough for more than 1 1/2 to 2 hours of entertainment in its entirety.  Other valley organizations are cheaper, and have a lot more to offer.  I'll wait until the Odyssey Aquarium is built next to it, before ever venturing back over to that area.	0
I am sick to my stomach!!  I just had a bug on the lemon in my water.  When addressed with the manager Dan he was unprofessional and failed to provide any sympathy and or apology on behalf of the restaurant. He comped the POTATO CHIPS on our bill!!. I understand stuff happens however its the tact in how the situation is handled when something does go wrong that will make or break the after thoughts of your customer. I will NOT be returning to this restaurant	0
I really want to give NO STAR. This is absolutely the worst restaurant ever. No service. Had to get my own water jug to pour my own water.  and the food is absolutely horrible. i wouldn't call it chinese food. i wouldn't even call it asian food. It's edible. that all i can say.  It's a restaurant to fool white people who never had real chinese cuisine.  It's lucky its in AZ, because if this food court were in CA, it would never survive.  NO chinese ppl with a decent palate will ever walk into this imitation panda express which is worse than panda express.  i feel sorry for AZ residents where good cuisine is really lacking.	0
Wow! I'm stunned at the high average rating of this place. It found this place mediocre, and quite disappointing.\n\nThe fellas and I went to Vegas for the weekend and got three suites here. The rooms weren't bad, but they certainly didn't \""wow\"" me with their plush-ness. The worst thing about them was how dark they were. The walls were painted dark grey, and all the interior design was similarly color-themed. No matter how many lights were on, and with all the blinds open, the room was still dreary. \n\nThe buffet was good. Props for that.\n\nThe Brazilian BBQ at Rum Jungle was a letdown. See my review of Espetus in San Francisco for what Brazilian BBQ should be. At Rum Jungle, the food was okay, but the experience wasn't what it should have been. Rather than pick your own side dishes from a serve-yourself salad bar, the waiters decided what side dishes were coming, in what quantity, and how fast. Hardly the self-gorging experience Brazilian BBQ should be. Same with the meats. \n\nThe last straw happened when I went to hit the gym one morning. I walked up and was told \""there is a $20 fee for hotel guests to use the gym.\"" My head spun around. That's right, $20 for PAYING GUESTS to lift weights. Call me crazy, but I think that if an activity costs the hotel nothing, it should cost the guest nothing. Outrageous. Wait it gets better. I grudgingly forked over 20 bucks, and thought: this is likely to be the nicest gym I have ever been in. There will probably be strippers handing me my weights. Holy nope. This facility was a POS. I have been in nicer gyms in crappy apartment complexes. The whole place was probably 1000 square feet, with only 400 square feet devoted to weights. The place was lit by very dim fluorescent lights. Flattering. There was no free weight bench press. WTF? Talk about standard equipment! I was pissed the whole time, and I had a shitty workout as a result. I had dropped $250 in the casino that weekend, but that $20 hurt way worse. In the end, I protested to the front desk, and without contest, they reimbursed me my $20, so that was good.\n\nOverall, this place is mediocre at best. I will choose to stay somewhere else next time.	0
Slow slow slow...kept forgetting things, forgot an entire meal for one person in our party. Every request we had took at least 5 minutes. Horrible experience.	0
By far the WORST shipping experience ever. There were two people in front of me, each with one envelope and it took more than 30 minutes for them to get to me. Not only this but the Manager of all people asked the woman behind me what she was here for before even taking a single glance at me. The employees here are incompetent and unhelpful. Go to a different FedEx store if you want to make it out before you're old and crippled.	0
CLOSED!  AND THE BIG SLIDES REMOVED??\n\nNot sure what is going on here, looks to be some renovations I'll be totally bummed if they lose the big slides.	0
What can I say? Over rated to say the least !	0
I hate this store. I never thought that I could say this about a Target. \n\nEverytime I have been here, the police are Here. So frequent, that by the handicapped parking is specific parking for law enforcement only.\n\nThe store is really picked over, with no star bucks, petite baskets, and a lot of un happy looking employees.\n\nSomething about this store just feels dirty to me..and the feeling carries on to the parking lot. Baskets everywhere, trash, it really needs some TLC.	0
Always delicious. Don't miss the homemade root beer!	1
Best Atmosphere for any hour of the day for sure.  Every dish that I have ordered there has been fantastic!  The pretzel bread on their burger is amazing!  The only reason that I give 4 stars rather than 5 is the service- I have had my order messed up and it seems to take a little longer than I think it should be HOWEVER they are ALWAYS busy so that needs to be taken into account.  Maybe they should have another server on, who knows, I am not the management :-)	1
I'm not sure why, but it seems as if all of these \""sister hotels\"" end up falling a little bit short of the original. The Palazzo isn't as good as the Venetian, and similarly, Encore isn't as good as the Wynn. \n\nLet me start off by saying that I'm still a fan of Encore - the rooms are beautiful (5 stars!) and they have all of the fun stuff like XS, the Encore Beach Club, and Surrender. However, there's just something lacking. If you stay at Encore, you have to keep walking over to the Wynn anyway - all of the casual dining options are over there, and they have a larger casino that just feels more upbeat. \n\nI guess the best way to put it is this: Encore is great as an attachment to the Wynn, but it couldn't stand alone as its own hotel and casino. \n\nSide Note: They're good about safety! I lost my room key somewhere in the casino, and the rest of my group had left the hotel to watch a show elsewhere. Because the reservation wasn't under my name, the guy at the front desk wouldn't issue another room key for me. It made sense, so I didn't complain...but damn! I had no choice but to gamble some more. Two hours of roulette later, my friends came back and I was finally able to go back to our room...broke, of course.	1
What a fine place in dine in! It is rare situation to go to a restaurant with a group of mixed friends- and by mixed I mean meat eaters and veggies :) - and for all parties be happy with the quality of the food. I didn't realize that this place was so vegetarian friendly until I went out on a Friday night with some coworkers. The place was so awesomely designed that it feels upscale but also laid back at the same time. The people who work there know their stuff and are great at making suggestions- and I ended up getting the veggie sausage and chili- and everything was scrumptious. Coupled with a good beer selection and a few great whiskeys on the menu, this is a great place to get your booze and food on. The one not-so-good surprise for me was that the place was actually pretty quiet.... on a Friday night.  It's quite possible that things get a bit more interesting later in the night, but it did seem that the focus was more on the food and restaurant rather than the bar- which is great- however the next time I go I'd like to go a little later to make sure to be there when the action happens.	1
This place is great!  Food, cocktails and service exceeded all of our expectations.	1
Okay. Let me tell you something about The Bold Roost. It opened two weeks ago. Two weeks ago and it already is my favorite place in my area. You walk in here and the employees immediately treat you like family. Always asking me how I am with a smile on their face as soon as I walk in. I get my usual tea or caramel based drink and sit down. It's defiantly a coffee shop vibe here. Lounge chairs with wifi. Relaxing without a doubt. They have my drink ready quick and will always ask me how it is and tend to every catered need. As always, it's amazing. The best expresso of all time. People here are friendly and are up for a chat whenever. A great time whenever I come here. So, please, if you are looking for great customer service, amazing drinks, paninis, and overall an amazing experience come to The Bold Roost. It's just starting as an upcoming coffee shop and it's already amazing. It can only get better too! Overall, I'm proud to say my family will be a regular here for a very long time to come. Five stars and good luck Bold Roost!!!	1
*Dog park area review only*\nWe've been slowly making our rounds trying out dog parks with our new pup. So far this ones my favorite. The off leash areas were nice and big and the grass was well kept. Water fountain/faucet inside the run, which was helpful on the hot days.  Lots of friendly dogs and their owners. A couple benches are available to take a load off while your fuzzy one frolics. Separate areas designated for large and small dogs, but we noticed not everyone goes by the rules, which is fine by us, our pup likes all dogs. As with most parks not all the poop is picked up and some trash is left behind, even though there are plenty of \""doggy bags\"" and trash cans. But it is actually really clean.\nWe haven't gotten to explore the rest of the park but it looks large with lots of amenities.	1
Amazing!  Stop searching and go buy tickets!  I bought these last minute and couldn't have been happier about the whole experience.  It is as good (actually better in my opinion) than any Cirque shows.  Why?  Because it is funny, edgy, and acrobatic.  Also we waited until almost everyone had lined up and we still had great seats!!!!  It was truly entertainment at its best.	1
This rating is for our server Wanda and the food!!!  She did her best to greet her customers, clear the tables, take the order and serve her customer with a smile.  They are definitely understaffed, and I witnessed a manager reprimand another staff member in front of a crowded restaurant full of customers.	1
They're open year-round and they have the full DQ menu, though I rarely stray from the onion rings. I used to come here so often that I started to get paranoid I was becoming known as \""the blizzard guy.\""	1
I am a local here in Las Vegas but love visiting this mini mall over fashion show any day. Regardless of how pricey it is due to it being inside the hotel. I am very entertained with the different statues of greek gods and wall murals. It does not feel like I am in Las Vegas at all. Towards the end of the forum shops a mini show happens every hour, just a bunch of animated god/goddess with a story to tell. If you love The Cheese Cake Factory you would not miss it atl it. It is right there!!!!\nYou will also find the apple store, christian loubton, nike, h&m and many more other shops in here. But do not forget everything is expensive in the strip so if you want to save a little more, outlets south end of the strip and north end are available. \n\nTwo ways of getting in here from Las Vegas Blvd, either you do Valet at the main entrance where you check in or if you head out to the right side of Caesars you will also notice the valet for the mall. Head up north and you will see the self parking sign that leads right in the middle of the casino and mall.. \n\nAs a first timer you will be bound to get lost, I still do!! LOL! Caesars Palace in general is a big hotel. Or if you are lost employees are very friendly so dont hesitant to ask them.	1
Surprisingly not bad.	1
I met a friend for dinner here a few nights ago - some all you can eat and some Hockey on the provided TVs by the bar.  \n\nThe restaurant is nicely laid out.  The service is professional and well planned.  And the prices, with AYCE, are very decent.  The atmosphere was lively for a weeknight.\n\nThe popcorn lobster roll might just be the most beautiful thing I've found in a sushi bar in a very long time.  It will have me coming back for more of its delicious fried beautifulness.  I think this is something that this bar can call its own - that it has actually created something I'd never tasted before at a sushi bar.  And I think that says a fair amount. \n\nAlso, the fish was fresh and that is very, very important when you're looking to consume raw.  Good location and its definitely worth the walk in if you're in the mood for sushi.	1
I can't accurately rate this place as I was here when I was sooo tired, that I'm surprised that I didn't pass out with my face in my food.  From what I recall the burger was pretty good, the wait was pretty long and the place was a little dark.  That is about all I can remember from this place.	1
This is the top of my list of buffets at LV. We did the \""Buffet of Buffets\"" for $39.99 and this was our 2nd buffet of the weekend. Out of all of the buffets we've been to (Paris, Planet Hollywood, & Caesars Palace) this is my favorite. Their wide variety of food suits every appetite I had. What I also liked about this buffet is that it's quite roomy, not cramped and crowded like my other buffets. Their crab is fresh and pre-cut so you don't have to struggle and crack anything. I am a little biased because I love tempura, and this is the only buffet (out of the 3) that actually had shrimp tempura.\n\nOverall the food is great, however I only gave them 4 stars because their refills for drinks can be a little more quicker. Otherwise this buffet is great!	1
As far as Waffle Houses go, this one was pretty clean.  I enjoyed the waffle and their coffee was surprisingly good.   Our waitress was probably well over 60 years old and she was the hardest working waitress I have ever seen - she hustled	1
Everyone knows about Pei Wei right?! I really thought so until my boyfriend admitted that he had never been. Challenge accepted. \n\nNow, I've been a frequent Pei Wei customer ever since I discovered Asian food did not always have to send to you running to the restroom. (Yeah, thanks for nothing Bing Heng and Great Wall Buffet). This isn't the best Asian food ever, but it is quick, accessible, and always pretty tasty. \n\nI've tried everything on the menu, but my favorite options are the Crab Wontons and the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken. I ordered these plus the Spicy Korean for my n00b boyfriend to try, and everything went better than expected. \n\nIn fact, he even commented that the place was \""classier\"" than he expected. \n\nJust a side note: you can order and pay online, so you don't have to wait for the takeout line. You can also choose the specific time you would like to pick up your food.	1
Great service. Very smart and friendly staff. The manager and his team are the real deal.	1
I actually liked this course... maybe because I shot well on it, and that I went with some other people that paid for it, and I was on vacation and.....\n\nOk.. it wasn't a GREAT course, but the experience was good.   Probably a moderate level course that, as many vegas courses are, was relatively well kept up and wasn't that busy.	1
This is a wonderful place to stay in the Summerlin area of Las Vegas. The friendly and attentive service here rivals hotels with a much higher nightly rate. The rooms are modern and clean and best of all very functional. With access to a number of business areas close-by, there are quite a few really good dining, coffee and shopping options within a minute or two drive.  Will definitely stay here again the next time I am in the area!	1
We started with the arugula salad. Which i found to be very good. The price is high but what do you expect in Vegas? The food was good but it is a lot to be spending on food that wasn't anything spectacular.. Lasagna was okay the salmon was much better!!	1
I went to another Ultrazone laser tag birthday party recently. Rock on! \n\nSeriously, I have tons of fun playing this game. I learned this time that it is better to team up with at least one other person. This way you don't get nailed too many times (one covers the front, the other covers behind) and you can protect each other when you are trying to kill bases. Don't forget to hit them all cuz that's how you win the most points for your team!\n\nOnto the birthday party aspect though. IF (God forbid) I was a parent, I would totally want my kid's birthday party to be held here. My brother and I didn't have to do a thing. We sat there with the kids while the \""Game Master\"" served us and the kids pizza, drinks, and cake. \n\nAll of this for only $240 including tip!! That fed two adults and 13 kids with plenty of leftovers and 2 games of laser tag. Seriously...so worth it which is why I am upgrading to 5 STARS!	1
After leaving Seattle I went looking for a new tattoo shop to call my own, and though it took years, I've finally found it in Golden Rule Tattoo. The shop is simple and clean, the guys are all very talented and make you feel like family. Alex Empty has given me two beautiful tattoos and I'm working on some more ideas, but I wouldn't hesitate to go to any of the fellas that work here. I tell everyone I know to check Golden Rule out, even if you think you like another shop you owe it to yourself to see what else is out there.	1
Great location for dinner. Both the food and service was excellent. I would go again next time I am in Montreal.	1
It's not often I walk into a nightclub and think wow... the employees are really nice. I'm not saying they're giving you 5 star service, but at least they smile as they take your ID and tell you to have a good time.\n\nSome have mentioned the prices of the drinks to be expensive. Well... I didn't think they were any more or less than other venues I've been to that have music. $5 for a beer to me or less is not bad.\n\nI really liked the layout of the club. I liked the booths in the back where I could watch from an elevated area and not get into the mosh pit for Napalm Death and Devil Driver. Sound was pretty good and the bathrooms were cleans. The place looked much nicer than I'd expect to see a metal show. There were Ganesh statues, tapestry covers for the booths, ....\n\nThe place has good ventilation and despite all the smokers around me, I wasn't choking like I would be at the Double Down.\n\nOn Saturday nights they have a murder mystery theater thing from 6 to 8pm. I haven't gone but I can see where this venue would be a great place for something like this too.\n\nI liked this place enough to where I'd actively look to see what shows are coming to this place and come back again soon.	1
While pregnant I gained 50 lbs!..I was so embarrassed of the weight I had gained that I told myself I refuse to use my pregnancy as an excuse!..I've been working with meek bleek for awhile now and have since then lost 45 lbs!..I love his work outs and motivation!..I totally recommend this guy as he is genuine in his concern of getting you to where you want to be!..I couldn't ask for a better trainer!	1
Seriously the best BBQ in the area.  I like the pulled pork best.  I have also had the brisket, but it was a little too smoky for me.  I didn't even think that was possible, but it was.  \n\nChips and salsa are spot on.  You wouldn't think to order them at a BBQ place, but definitely do, they are well worth it.\n\nHands down favorite thing at this place: cornbread!  It comes out all warm and goey.  It has pork and whole bunch of other stuff in it that make it extra special.  The prices are unbeatable too.  Dinner for two, I'd be shocked if you spent more than $30 total with drinks.  \n\nI've heard the wait can be bad, but I was there on a Saturday night at 7pm and only waited maybe 10 minutes.  It was so good though I would wait much longer!\n\nHighly recommended!	1
Hello all,\n\nI've had the opportunity to visit three times so far and all experiences did not disappoint. The food quality is fantastic. It's great authentic food for a GREAT value. The Salmon and Tuna Ceviche is the best. And, the Carne Asada is very tasty and well prepared. My colleagues at my third visit had the Blackened Mahi Mahi and were indeed satisfied. I had a taste ant it was perfectly cooked and seasoned.\n\nThe service has been on par at every visit, particularly my second visit. This was a group birthday dinner on a Friday night. The guest of honor was running late and the host staff were very gracious enough to offer their office to store our many birthday gifts until all guests arrived. They also offered a better table that would meet our needs.\n\nSo, after three visits, when I am in Shadyside and hungry, I look forward to dining at Steel Cactus.\n\nColleen C.	1
Awesome food!  We walked all over, and this place had only a few minutes wait, we sat right next to the fountain 'outside' (inside the Forum) - Really nice.  We had 3 different pastas and all 3 were fresh and done very well.	1
I've eaten here a number of times. Tried a bunch of different omelettes and burgers. The volcano burger was amazing. Their breakfast buffet is delicious also. The bar service was really good, great drink selection.  I must say I was impressed for a hotel restaurant.	1
This is unequivocally the best attraction in town for children of all ages. Last year I came here with a six year old and we spent the entire day in the museum. She wasn't bored for a second. The only thing that happened is her grandfather and grandmother ran out of steam and eventually had to leave. Coming back again this year we were with a 4 year old and a 7 year old. Again, never a dull moment with tons to do that kept each of them interested and excited. There are three floors of different activities. Many of them are hands on. They are many diverse crafts to do. There's a grocery store. A auto mechanic shop. There's a place for construction. And there is the water area ( be aware, there is a real risk of getting soaking wet despite the fact that they provide rain ponchos for the kids). They do have hand dryers on the wall to help decrease the amount of water you take home but the kids really do get wet. At about $12 ahead, this is a real bargain. Highly recommended. I know I will be back again next year when my grandchildren come to visit.	1
Being hungry for Asian food in the south hills can leave one feeling a bit empty with the choices available, especially if you aren't in the mood for a belly full of cornstarch. Seeing that Mekong had Pho and good ratings, we were off to give it a shot. We entered a mostly empty restaurant with only a handful of tables and what seemed to be one woman running the front and back(I later found out there is another woman in the kitchen).\n\nWe were told to sit anywhere we'd like and immediately given water. We looked at the menu, standard american-chinese fare with some vietnamese specialties thrown in, including the Pho I had come for. My brother is a fan of General Tso's but wasn't exactly in the mood for it, so our waitress recommended he try the specialty 'Emperor' Chicken - apparently a bit more sweet and sour than your basic General Tso's. \n\nAlong with ordering, I indicated that my brother was severely allergic to nuts of all sorts, expecting to be given the standard response of 'oh, I'll check' or a vague 'they're cooked in the same area.. how allergic is he?'. No, the server, who referred to herself as Ma, explained that only two types of dished contained nuts, and that they were kept in a plastic container away from the other ingredients - completely reassuring us that no mix-ups could happen.\n\nThe food came out fairly quickly, the pho was hot but without standard items like sriracha and hoisin. No matter, the flavor was perfect, probably my favorite in the city. I was in the mood for spicy, so I did indeed ask for sriracha. She said she didn't give it because it gives the pho a lemony off-taste if you use too much of it, but that she could help me out. She went into the kitchen and brought out a small dish containing a finely sliced, bright red thai chili, warning a little goes a long way. I'm no stranger to this type of chili and throwing the whole thing in did indeed give me plenty of heat and burst of super-fresh chili flavor. I asked for a small bowl to share and she was happy to deliver that as well.\n\nThe Emperor Chicken was OK, full of large chunks of red and green peppers and onions if you like that - I prefer broccoli as my vegetable in dishes like that. It was bright and flavorful, though, and a large portion. Ma was friendly with us while we ate, asking whereabout we lived, and telling us anytime we needed to eat something good, just come see her.\n\nAll in all, this place has wonderful Pho. If you're trapped in the South Hills looking for something warm to fill you up, or just looking for a great family-run restaurant with friendly service and great chinese-american food, stop in and give Mekong a try.	1
