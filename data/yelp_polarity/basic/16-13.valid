Paid $1200+ for a table, we were outside with 20 mph winds and too cold for girls in dresses. They wouldn't move us. Awful customer service. Staff was sympathetic but ultimately unhelpful.	0
One of those restaurants where you go in, and go \""huh, why is it sooo empty\"".  Albeit it's a Wed nght, but it's also Restaurant Week... I even felt like we owned the entry area of the Theodore.. never saw a soul except a desk guy hidden in an alcove.  Park in the adjacent Buckboard lot, as there was a sign stating Guest Parking $10 though I didn't see an attendant who could collect.\n\n4 people, all a variety of dishes from the very promising sounding menu so we definitely had the works.  It just did not wow.  I appreciated the papardelle pasta was freshly made (but kept tossing overboard to my bf the mushy bland short rib meat... mid week leftovers?) and the meyer lemon tart.  General repeated comment re: our mains... salty.\n\nNow I can see this being a place for lounging and drinks, especially if they were to draw those curtains down around you to cozy up your table.  But I want to like the food too.	0
I am officially not a fan. I went here tonight with some friends to see Tangled. We get stopped at the door and they ask to search my bag. First off, searching bags of customers have gotten a LOT of theaters in trouble, even sued. THESE SEARCHES ARE ILLEGAL. It's called privacy invasion. So good job there. Secondly, even if I am carrying snacks (which I was - let's be honest, those prices are extortionate even for a \""dollar\"" theater and there's not too many vegan goods) I was still going to buy popcorn - that story will come in a moment. Debate about the ethical reasoning of bringing in snacks all you want, but I don't want anyone searching my private property unless they are actual security or police. \n\nSo we take our snacks back to the car and go into the theater. My friends go to find a seat, and I stand in line for some popcorn. Note that there are no signs saying CASH ONLY anywhere. (NOTE: my friend paid for the movie so I didn't notice at the box office if signs were there or not.) When I finally get to the counter after 7 minutes of waiting (seriously the staff was working like they were underwater) I am told they don't take cards, but I can go to the ATM off to the side. Are you freakin' serious?! Why the hell would I go to an ATM when all I want is a small popcorn? There should be signage so I didn't have to waste my damn time. This subsequently put me in an awful mood for the rest of the time I was there. \n\nAs for the theater - when they shut off the lights you can't see a thing. It took me 2 minutes to find my friends. The sound quality of the movie was not great and I could hear every single person munching on popcorn and slurping drinks. So not enjoyable. Kids running around screaming and crying as well - overall a complete disaster. \n\nTreating your customers as criminals is not okay in my book, and I can assure you I will not be back here - I would rather pay the extra dough for stadium seating, debit card acceptance, and not having my bag searched (it wasn't even a big bag!). And that's saying a lot from someone who likes spending her money on shoes. Shame on you, Tropicana Cinemas.	0
I'm pissed.  Surprised...and pissed.  What the hell happened to Orange Table!?  My boyfriend and I stopped for breakfast on Sunday and experienced the worst service I think that I have had anywhere!\n\nWe ordered breakfast.  After waiting 25 minutes (for eggs, people...eggs...this is not a big deal), I went inside (because the waiter was not conscientious enough to come to us) to ask if there was a problem with our order.  The response was, and I quote, \""The kitchen is backed up; it should be out in a few minutes.\""  Note: there was no apology for the wait, and no effort to appease me.\n\nAfter waiting another 10 minutes, a waitress came by and asked generally if we were having a good day.  When we said that we would feel better about our day if we were able to get our food, the response was, and I quote: \""Haven't you ever been here on the weekend.  We are always slow on the weekend.\""  Are you friggin' kidding me!!!?  This is an appropriate response!?  Again, no apology.  No offer of coffee or roll or something while we wait.  And is slow service EVER an acceptable policy!?\n\nA few more minutes went by; my boyfriend and I stood up to leave just as our food was coming.  We even said to the waiter, \""We were just going to leave.\""  No response.  None!  Couldn't friggin' believe it.\n\nI used to tell everyone about this place.  No more.	0
I ordered a carne asada burrito and a beef taco here around 3pm on a weekday. The beef taco was pretty good, the cheese was fresh and the lettuce tasted clean. \n\nHowever, the carne asada burrito was not good, I tried covering it up with salsa,  still not good. The steak was burnt looking, maybe it had been sitting for awhile. I don't recommend the steak for anything.\n\nThe new breakfast burrito is tasty as long as they do not burn the eggs. This place is hit or miss.	0
Ordered a whiskey river bbq burger medium well, got served a patty that was cooked fine on one side but the other was charred to the point it was inedible due to the taste. The bottomless fries were thin, hard and almost stale...this is out of the norm as a year ago this place was actually pretty good, not now. With smash burger down the street there's no point to come here, especially due to their policy of no legal firearms on their premises.  Guess they don't realize signage holds no weight in Nevada and they must think criminals won't walk past that sign.  Their loss five guys or smash burger it is.	0
I'm sorry to say that I am not a fan. I was so wishing for something to write home (or Yelp) about, but I walked away disappointed. The place was really not in good condition. The chairs were broken and the vinyl was torn on them. The table was sticky (THAT\""S THE WORST!), the staff were not friendly, and the food was only mediocre. Gosh I really wanted to like it!\n\nOne thing is that the seating area was so small that I was always feeling in the way and I couldn't relax and just eat. The tables are very close and some ladies were seated next to us and it felt like they were actually AT my table. That wouldn't be a big deal if they were nice people. They were very loud and speaking in a language that was not my own. They only would steal a few looks at us when they thought we weren't looking. It is natural to think that the people are talking about you, right? That's how I felt for some reason.\n\nAvoid this place if possible. There are other places nearby that are better. Pho Kim Long for instance.	0
Geisha A No No. That's its real name. Didn't you know? \n\nContrary to what the Phx News Times said in an online review, this place does not open for lunch. Imagine our disappointment, for a trio of hungry co-workers had been planning a lunch escape to this location for quite some time. (What can we say except domo arigato, mr. roboto.)\n\nUhm, the door was unlocked, though. Just as we began to pull it open, thinking they had just opened for lunch, a man in a gray t-shirt approached. \n\n\""Hey, we're not open.\"" \n\""We read an online review that you were open for lunch.\""\n\""Nope. We've never been open for lunch.\""\n\""Oh...\""\n\""Come back for happy hour. We open every day at 5.\""\nMy co-worker checked his watch. \""That's only 5 hours from now. Thanks.\""\n\nAnd then he walked off. No \""thank you.\"" No \""let me tell you about your other options in the area.\"" Nothing. He just walked toward the back of the business. Must be the owner or manager. I would think that if patrons (attempted ones at that) were trying to check out your place, you'd at least paste on a smile, stop to tell them about the area and welcome them back for dinner, with a complimentary app. But nope. \n\nBelieve me, I've seen their HH menu and it sucks. Tempura everything. Sure, load me up on fried foods. Of course the interior is pleasing. I love the idea of green walls. But I will not be coming back here. \n\nI don't know how they stay in business. They must offer other \""services\"" behind closed curtains in their private rooms.	0
review of the time share presentation only since we didn't stay there.\n\nwe took a bus from luxor to go to this time share presentation from the lure of $100 in gaming chips. WOO! we had nothing better to do so we hopped on the bus and it took forever to get to this place. close to the strip MY ASS. i wondered that if i did end up buying the time share with my imaginary money, i'd definitely need a car to get to the strip and back.\n\nanyway, we get to the time share presentation and the three of us get barbie girl as our salesperson. we told her right away we were there for the gaming chips and she said she needed to pitch us anyway. she told us all this mumbo jumbo and gave us a tour of the facilities. pretty cool but it's so effing far from the strip and you can stay at hotel condos on the strip or close to it like the MGM signature. why would you stay here? the furniture and kitchen are were nice and big and i remember seeing a bath tub in a random part of the room. the sex room. hahaha.\n\nanyway after the tour she comes back and gives us a free lunch which was supposed to be \""amazing\"" but it was nasty. i could have crapped out a better lunch blind. plus the cookies were stale and the coffee was nasty. blech. \n\nshe gave her pitch we said no, she walked back and forth and gave us lower and lower deals and we said no. she said thanks and we go to another room with another man who looked like his job was to close deals we said no. he gave us a ridiculous deal that was way below what the other lady gave us. uh.... so is that what it's really worth? we said no. \n\nthen we go to another guy who has the \""chips\"" and he tries again but not as hard and we say no and give us our chips. he finally gives it to us and we go back to luxor and we realize the chips were the ones that we had to turn into real chips so we couldn't just cash it out. we play until we can turn them into real chips, cash it out, and leave, 5-6 hours later.\n\nI still talk about this experience to friends and it's a funny convo starter so for that i give it one more star. one star for the cash. zero stars for the food and sales pitch. blech.	0
Rain prevented us from golfing one day, so the four of us decided to get something to eat.  Heard there were some good Chinese restaurants in Chandler and didn't have a specific place in mind.  Just drove and happened on Sun Chinese.  My husband and I are Chinese so we know Chinese food and this was not it.  Not until reading the other reviews did we realize it was a \""Korean Chinese\"" restaurant.  Never heard of such a thing.  Maybe they do Korean well, but the \""Chinese\"" food we order was not good.  The waitress first brought out a small portion of  fried won ton strips w/ a sweet and sour sauce for dipping that were greasy and tasted like they had been sitting around for days. Hot and sour soup had way too much cornstarch.  Other main dishes also weren't that great and some of it was just strange.	0
Hadn't been here since they changed from Fado's, but I stopped in at happy hour for a friend's birthday. The appetizers were very good but here's the kicker...\n\n$9.73 for a tall Guinness... at happy hour? Who am I, Donald Trump?\n\nI'm sure I'll go here again, possibly for dinner... but I dont know who named it Happy Hour.	0
What do you get when an iconic NYC bar opens a second location in Las Vegas? Well, does it have a loud mouthy bitch in a low cut top serving drinks? Check. How about the big, fat doorman w/ bald head, leather vest and a long beard? Check. Will you hear \""Slowride\"" played at a mind numbing volume? Check Again!!!\n\nSo, what's the problem here? Maybe it's just the pretentious forced feeling that this place wants the reputation it didn't establish. Cool dive bars aren't chains. I don't think any of us think Applebee's when we tell people about our favorite neighborhood restaurant, but for the most part that's exactly what the Las Vegas H&H is. Sure it's got the look, the sound, plenty bikes and bad ass cars parked out front and no shortage of people playing the part, but it feels more like a production rather than a well earned atmosphere.\n\nI wanted to like this place, we've stopped there 3X but w/ so many bars in the Downtown area opening that aren't replicas of another location, you'll be like most and soon find a watering hole that better suits your taste. As one that spends a lot of time in Downtown, I'd say you'd never kick yourself for missing this place; but, if interest gets the better of you, you can always do what we saw most doing last time we visited: buy a drink, watch the bar theatre and pick up some Tchotchke to bring back to wherever your from to say you went.	0
Dumbbells everywhere. Not labeled. Smells a lil funky. It is a nice gym but just not maintained very well.	0
I've experienced much better.   I love food, I just LOVE LOVE LOVE me some food.  The food here is... meh.   I've been three times, and my general reaction is 2-3 stars at best for each of my visits.  Hey, can I get that without the green chilis?  No?  What about... can I get this with the sauce on the side?  No?  Can I...? Never mind, she just WALKED AWAY.\n\nAfter three visits with these folks, I have had a 100% consistent issue with getting seated- and this place actually earned its own tweet (I rarely tweet) because of the consistently snippy, unhelpful, and downright stand-offish response when we try to come spend our $400 there for a group lunch. So... two stars for consistency... that does seem to indicate a \""policy\"" and hooray for you, to be able to maintain such a strict adherence to your policies.  I guess. \n\nIt's unfortunate that there's one person on our admin staff that just ADORES this disaster of a chain, thus we end up getting dragged here for their annual \""work anniversary\"" lunch celebration.  No amount of calling ahead to see what can be done to make things go more smoothly for the staff at Oregano's (why wouldn't you want to know that a party of 15 is on its way?) and I've long since given up on trying to make things go smoothly for our staff.    I know you don't take reservations, I'm not trying to break your rules... I'm calling with a head's up to let you know that we have a group coming in 2 days from now.  And when I call ahead as they open that day to let them know, and I get the same defensive reaction.  Again, not trying to break your rules.  Just trying to see what CAN be done- but thank you for the thorough scolding on all of the things that CAN'T be done.\n\nThe rule here -*******take note if you're going to be with a group******- is that they WILL NOT SEAT YOU unless every member of your party is there.  That last person who stayed behind to lock the door and then caught the red light?  No, no, we can't seat the other 14 of you, that last, 15th, person has to be here before you can have your table.\n\nI've experienced this at the Chandler location once, in 2011... as well as the Gilbert location twice (once in 2012 and once in December of 2013).  \n\nWhen I was a kid (oh yes, I went there), there was a place in Phoenix called Ed Debevicks (I believe)... it was a 50's New York diner-style experience, complete with waiters and waitresses that would strive to exceed each other in the ways that they could be outrageously, hilariously, rude.  They'd shove you over so they could sit down while they took your order.  They'd loudly chew gum and take a sip of your drink.  They might call you names, they'd for sure snort and roll their eyes, but at the end of the day it was all a joke.  As they were putting on the act, they were covertly on the BALL with your order, with a new drink and refills, with getting your order correct and hot and on your table quickly.  \n\nOreganos?  Well... they're rude.  Aaaand... that's it.\n\nGood for groups: No\nGood when you need to catch a movie: No\nGood for work lunch (you have to be done in a reasonable time frame): No\n\nI tried to order Alfredo the Dark with one modification:  Nope. Can't do it.  Okay, that's fair.\n\nI tried to order the Lady is a Scampi: our server said \""It's spicy and we won't take it back if it's too spicy\"".  Well, I like to put sriracha sauce on my pizza, and I order my wings \""Hot\"" wherever I go, but she was so severe, I was worried about dropping $15 and going hungry for the rest of my work day. \n\nI have ordered a Julius Cesar salad with chicken (huge), which was good, but I've had better.\n\nI have ordered the Zany Ziti, and found it unbearably bland.  And I do believe pasta and pizza is like sex... even when it isn't the BEST you've ever had... well, I'm not going to complain.   But... really, really BLAND.  I thought, like some pastas, that it just needed a day to sort of meld the flavors, so I looked forward to having it as a leftover the next day, but it came in a breadbowl, which then rendered it inedible as a leftover the next day. \n\nI've had the thin crust pizza, which was fine.  I mean... *straining to say something nice* ...yeah.  It was ...fine.\n\nSo, kids, as much as I struggle emotionally with leaving a 2-star review... that's been my experience after three visits - and next year for my co-worker's anniversary, I'll wish her well and then probably head up Gilbert Road to Joe's BBQ.	0
Been there 3 times in 2 days been treated horrible.  Pass on this place & how they operate.\n1- They refused to honor their $1 off coupon on 2 occasions, then refused another coupon after they made the sandwich they said was good.   Complete morons and horrible service and treatment.  They switch to spanish and knew they were being even more rude.	0
This was our third stop during our Sunday bar hopping schedule. Typically, I read up on the places near by as we munch an appetizer and savor a tasty beverage. On this occasion we skipped that formality as the previous bartender said that Kona had great food and cheap happy hour prices.\n\nWhen we arrived, we quickly found two seats at the outdoor bar. I will have to give them a nod for places to people watch. Across from us was a Wilem Dafoe look alike in a black wife beater. He kept muttering to himself (I secretly suspect that he was arguing with himself). A couple of seats down from him was a dude that was rockin the full beach dude hair...party on bra\n\nOk back to Kona, happy hour drinks were ok, and they were cheap ($5), but the ultra lounge bartenders seemed busier than necessary. We finally settle on a sushi roll for our obligatory app.\n\nNow sushi is one of those dishes that takes a great deal of finesse and precision. You are basically buying about A cup of rice and some uncooked tasties for wrap and filling. Our roll was a happy hour special, so $5 for what would normally cost $10.\n\nWhat we got was a sad mangled roll. The pieces were so poorly cut, from the side it looked like a cell phone add showing how many bars you can get in this area. The taste was ok, if a bit bland, and the serving temp was decidedly too warm for sushi.\n\nOk, bottom line here folks, stop buy Kona for happy hour drinks, watch the carnival of lost souls huddled around the bar, and skip the food.	0
Always delicious. Don't miss the homemade root beer!	1
Best Atmosphere for any hour of the day for sure.  Every dish that I have ordered there has been fantastic!  The pretzel bread on their burger is amazing!  The only reason that I give 4 stars rather than 5 is the service- I have had my order messed up and it seems to take a little longer than I think it should be HOWEVER they are ALWAYS busy so that needs to be taken into account.  Maybe they should have another server on, who knows, I am not the management :-)	1
I'm not sure why, but it seems as if all of these \""sister hotels\"" end up falling a little bit short of the original. The Palazzo isn't as good as the Venetian, and similarly, Encore isn't as good as the Wynn. \n\nLet me start off by saying that I'm still a fan of Encore - the rooms are beautiful (5 stars!) and they have all of the fun stuff like XS, the Encore Beach Club, and Surrender. However, there's just something lacking. If you stay at Encore, you have to keep walking over to the Wynn anyway - all of the casual dining options are over there, and they have a larger casino that just feels more upbeat. \n\nI guess the best way to put it is this: Encore is great as an attachment to the Wynn, but it couldn't stand alone as its own hotel and casino. \n\nSide Note: They're good about safety! I lost my room key somewhere in the casino, and the rest of my group had left the hotel to watch a show elsewhere. Because the reservation wasn't under my name, the guy at the front desk wouldn't issue another room key for me. It made sense, so I didn't complain...but damn! I had no choice but to gamble some more. Two hours of roulette later, my friends came back and I was finally able to go back to our room...broke, of course.	1
What a fine place in dine in! It is rare situation to go to a restaurant with a group of mixed friends- and by mixed I mean meat eaters and veggies :) - and for all parties be happy with the quality of the food. I didn't realize that this place was so vegetarian friendly until I went out on a Friday night with some coworkers. The place was so awesomely designed that it feels upscale but also laid back at the same time. The people who work there know their stuff and are great at making suggestions- and I ended up getting the veggie sausage and chili- and everything was scrumptious. Coupled with a good beer selection and a few great whiskeys on the menu, this is a great place to get your booze and food on. The one not-so-good surprise for me was that the place was actually pretty quiet.... on a Friday night.  It's quite possible that things get a bit more interesting later in the night, but it did seem that the focus was more on the food and restaurant rather than the bar- which is great- however the next time I go I'd like to go a little later to make sure to be there when the action happens.	1
This place is great!  Food, cocktails and service exceeded all of our expectations.	1
Okay. Let me tell you something about The Bold Roost. It opened two weeks ago. Two weeks ago and it already is my favorite place in my area. You walk in here and the employees immediately treat you like family. Always asking me how I am with a smile on their face as soon as I walk in. I get my usual tea or caramel based drink and sit down. It's defiantly a coffee shop vibe here. Lounge chairs with wifi. Relaxing without a doubt. They have my drink ready quick and will always ask me how it is and tend to every catered need. As always, it's amazing. The best expresso of all time. People here are friendly and are up for a chat whenever. A great time whenever I come here. So, please, if you are looking for great customer service, amazing drinks, paninis, and overall an amazing experience come to The Bold Roost. It's just starting as an upcoming coffee shop and it's already amazing. It can only get better too! Overall, I'm proud to say my family will be a regular here for a very long time to come. Five stars and good luck Bold Roost!!!	1
*Dog park area review only*\nWe've been slowly making our rounds trying out dog parks with our new pup. So far this ones my favorite. The off leash areas were nice and big and the grass was well kept. Water fountain/faucet inside the run, which was helpful on the hot days.  Lots of friendly dogs and their owners. A couple benches are available to take a load off while your fuzzy one frolics. Separate areas designated for large and small dogs, but we noticed not everyone goes by the rules, which is fine by us, our pup likes all dogs. As with most parks not all the poop is picked up and some trash is left behind, even though there are plenty of \""doggy bags\"" and trash cans. But it is actually really clean.\nWe haven't gotten to explore the rest of the park but it looks large with lots of amenities.	1
Amazing!  Stop searching and go buy tickets!  I bought these last minute and couldn't have been happier about the whole experience.  It is as good (actually better in my opinion) than any Cirque shows.  Why?  Because it is funny, edgy, and acrobatic.  Also we waited until almost everyone had lined up and we still had great seats!!!!  It was truly entertainment at its best.	1
This rating is for our server Wanda and the food!!!  She did her best to greet her customers, clear the tables, take the order and serve her customer with a smile.  They are definitely understaffed, and I witnessed a manager reprimand another staff member in front of a crowded restaurant full of customers.	1
They're open year-round and they have the full DQ menu, though I rarely stray from the onion rings. I used to come here so often that I started to get paranoid I was becoming known as \""the blizzard guy.\""	1
I am a local here in Las Vegas but love visiting this mini mall over fashion show any day. Regardless of how pricey it is due to it being inside the hotel. I am very entertained with the different statues of greek gods and wall murals. It does not feel like I am in Las Vegas at all. Towards the end of the forum shops a mini show happens every hour, just a bunch of animated god/goddess with a story to tell. If you love The Cheese Cake Factory you would not miss it atl it. It is right there!!!!\nYou will also find the apple store, christian loubton, nike, h&m and many more other shops in here. But do not forget everything is expensive in the strip so if you want to save a little more, outlets south end of the strip and north end are available. \n\nTwo ways of getting in here from Las Vegas Blvd, either you do Valet at the main entrance where you check in or if you head out to the right side of Caesars you will also notice the valet for the mall. Head up north and you will see the self parking sign that leads right in the middle of the casino and mall.. \n\nAs a first timer you will be bound to get lost, I still do!! LOL! Caesars Palace in general is a big hotel. Or if you are lost employees are very friendly so dont hesitant to ask them.	1
Surprisingly not bad.	1
I met a friend for dinner here a few nights ago - some all you can eat and some Hockey on the provided TVs by the bar.  \n\nThe restaurant is nicely laid out.  The service is professional and well planned.  And the prices, with AYCE, are very decent.  The atmosphere was lively for a weeknight.\n\nThe popcorn lobster roll might just be the most beautiful thing I've found in a sushi bar in a very long time.  It will have me coming back for more of its delicious fried beautifulness.  I think this is something that this bar can call its own - that it has actually created something I'd never tasted before at a sushi bar.  And I think that says a fair amount. \n\nAlso, the fish was fresh and that is very, very important when you're looking to consume raw.  Good location and its definitely worth the walk in if you're in the mood for sushi.	1
I can't accurately rate this place as I was here when I was sooo tired, that I'm surprised that I didn't pass out with my face in my food.  From what I recall the burger was pretty good, the wait was pretty long and the place was a little dark.  That is about all I can remember from this place.	1
This is the top of my list of buffets at LV. We did the \""Buffet of Buffets\"" for $39.99 and this was our 2nd buffet of the weekend. Out of all of the buffets we've been to (Paris, Planet Hollywood, & Caesars Palace) this is my favorite. Their wide variety of food suits every appetite I had. What I also liked about this buffet is that it's quite roomy, not cramped and crowded like my other buffets. Their crab is fresh and pre-cut so you don't have to struggle and crack anything. I am a little biased because I love tempura, and this is the only buffet (out of the 3) that actually had shrimp tempura.\n\nOverall the food is great, however I only gave them 4 stars because their refills for drinks can be a little more quicker. Otherwise this buffet is great!	1
As far as Waffle Houses go, this one was pretty clean.  I enjoyed the waffle and their coffee was surprisingly good.   Our waitress was probably well over 60 years old and she was the hardest working waitress I have ever seen - she hustled	1
