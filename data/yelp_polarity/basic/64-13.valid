Paid $1200+ for a table, we were outside with 20 mph winds and too cold for girls in dresses. They wouldn't move us. Awful customer service. Staff was sympathetic but ultimately unhelpful.	0
One of those restaurants where you go in, and go \""huh, why is it sooo empty\"".  Albeit it's a Wed nght, but it's also Restaurant Week... I even felt like we owned the entry area of the Theodore.. never saw a soul except a desk guy hidden in an alcove.  Park in the adjacent Buckboard lot, as there was a sign stating Guest Parking $10 though I didn't see an attendant who could collect.\n\n4 people, all a variety of dishes from the very promising sounding menu so we definitely had the works.  It just did not wow.  I appreciated the papardelle pasta was freshly made (but kept tossing overboard to my bf the mushy bland short rib meat... mid week leftovers?) and the meyer lemon tart.  General repeated comment re: our mains... salty.\n\nNow I can see this being a place for lounging and drinks, especially if they were to draw those curtains down around you to cozy up your table.  But I want to like the food too.	0
I am officially not a fan. I went here tonight with some friends to see Tangled. We get stopped at the door and they ask to search my bag. First off, searching bags of customers have gotten a LOT of theaters in trouble, even sued. THESE SEARCHES ARE ILLEGAL. It's called privacy invasion. So good job there. Secondly, even if I am carrying snacks (which I was - let's be honest, those prices are extortionate even for a \""dollar\"" theater and there's not too many vegan goods) I was still going to buy popcorn - that story will come in a moment. Debate about the ethical reasoning of bringing in snacks all you want, but I don't want anyone searching my private property unless they are actual security or police. \n\nSo we take our snacks back to the car and go into the theater. My friends go to find a seat, and I stand in line for some popcorn. Note that there are no signs saying CASH ONLY anywhere. (NOTE: my friend paid for the movie so I didn't notice at the box office if signs were there or not.) When I finally get to the counter after 7 minutes of waiting (seriously the staff was working like they were underwater) I am told they don't take cards, but I can go to the ATM off to the side. Are you freakin' serious?! Why the hell would I go to an ATM when all I want is a small popcorn? There should be signage so I didn't have to waste my damn time. This subsequently put me in an awful mood for the rest of the time I was there. \n\nAs for the theater - when they shut off the lights you can't see a thing. It took me 2 minutes to find my friends. The sound quality of the movie was not great and I could hear every single person munching on popcorn and slurping drinks. So not enjoyable. Kids running around screaming and crying as well - overall a complete disaster. \n\nTreating your customers as criminals is not okay in my book, and I can assure you I will not be back here - I would rather pay the extra dough for stadium seating, debit card acceptance, and not having my bag searched (it wasn't even a big bag!). And that's saying a lot from someone who likes spending her money on shoes. Shame on you, Tropicana Cinemas.	0
I'm pissed.  Surprised...and pissed.  What the hell happened to Orange Table!?  My boyfriend and I stopped for breakfast on Sunday and experienced the worst service I think that I have had anywhere!\n\nWe ordered breakfast.  After waiting 25 minutes (for eggs, people...eggs...this is not a big deal), I went inside (because the waiter was not conscientious enough to come to us) to ask if there was a problem with our order.  The response was, and I quote, \""The kitchen is backed up; it should be out in a few minutes.\""  Note: there was no apology for the wait, and no effort to appease me.\n\nAfter waiting another 10 minutes, a waitress came by and asked generally if we were having a good day.  When we said that we would feel better about our day if we were able to get our food, the response was, and I quote: \""Haven't you ever been here on the weekend.  We are always slow on the weekend.\""  Are you friggin' kidding me!!!?  This is an appropriate response!?  Again, no apology.  No offer of coffee or roll or something while we wait.  And is slow service EVER an acceptable policy!?\n\nA few more minutes went by; my boyfriend and I stood up to leave just as our food was coming.  We even said to the waiter, \""We were just going to leave.\""  No response.  None!  Couldn't friggin' believe it.\n\nI used to tell everyone about this place.  No more.	0
I ordered a carne asada burrito and a beef taco here around 3pm on a weekday. The beef taco was pretty good, the cheese was fresh and the lettuce tasted clean. \n\nHowever, the carne asada burrito was not good, I tried covering it up with salsa,  still not good. The steak was burnt looking, maybe it had been sitting for awhile. I don't recommend the steak for anything.\n\nThe new breakfast burrito is tasty as long as they do not burn the eggs. This place is hit or miss.	0
Ordered a whiskey river bbq burger medium well, got served a patty that was cooked fine on one side but the other was charred to the point it was inedible due to the taste. The bottomless fries were thin, hard and almost stale...this is out of the norm as a year ago this place was actually pretty good, not now. With smash burger down the street there's no point to come here, especially due to their policy of no legal firearms on their premises.  Guess they don't realize signage holds no weight in Nevada and they must think criminals won't walk past that sign.  Their loss five guys or smash burger it is.	0
I'm sorry to say that I am not a fan. I was so wishing for something to write home (or Yelp) about, but I walked away disappointed. The place was really not in good condition. The chairs were broken and the vinyl was torn on them. The table was sticky (THAT\""S THE WORST!), the staff were not friendly, and the food was only mediocre. Gosh I really wanted to like it!\n\nOne thing is that the seating area was so small that I was always feeling in the way and I couldn't relax and just eat. The tables are very close and some ladies were seated next to us and it felt like they were actually AT my table. That wouldn't be a big deal if they were nice people. They were very loud and speaking in a language that was not my own. They only would steal a few looks at us when they thought we weren't looking. It is natural to think that the people are talking about you, right? That's how I felt for some reason.\n\nAvoid this place if possible. There are other places nearby that are better. Pho Kim Long for instance.	0
Geisha A No No. That's its real name. Didn't you know? \n\nContrary to what the Phx News Times said in an online review, this place does not open for lunch. Imagine our disappointment, for a trio of hungry co-workers had been planning a lunch escape to this location for quite some time. (What can we say except domo arigato, mr. roboto.)\n\nUhm, the door was unlocked, though. Just as we began to pull it open, thinking they had just opened for lunch, a man in a gray t-shirt approached. \n\n\""Hey, we're not open.\"" \n\""We read an online review that you were open for lunch.\""\n\""Nope. We've never been open for lunch.\""\n\""Oh...\""\n\""Come back for happy hour. We open every day at 5.\""\nMy co-worker checked his watch. \""That's only 5 hours from now. Thanks.\""\n\nAnd then he walked off. No \""thank you.\"" No \""let me tell you about your other options in the area.\"" Nothing. He just walked toward the back of the business. Must be the owner or manager. I would think that if patrons (attempted ones at that) were trying to check out your place, you'd at least paste on a smile, stop to tell them about the area and welcome them back for dinner, with a complimentary app. But nope. \n\nBelieve me, I've seen their HH menu and it sucks. Tempura everything. Sure, load me up on fried foods. Of course the interior is pleasing. I love the idea of green walls. But I will not be coming back here. \n\nI don't know how they stay in business. They must offer other \""services\"" behind closed curtains in their private rooms.	0
review of the time share presentation only since we didn't stay there.\n\nwe took a bus from luxor to go to this time share presentation from the lure of $100 in gaming chips. WOO! we had nothing better to do so we hopped on the bus and it took forever to get to this place. close to the strip MY ASS. i wondered that if i did end up buying the time share with my imaginary money, i'd definitely need a car to get to the strip and back.\n\nanyway, we get to the time share presentation and the three of us get barbie girl as our salesperson. we told her right away we were there for the gaming chips and she said she needed to pitch us anyway. she told us all this mumbo jumbo and gave us a tour of the facilities. pretty cool but it's so effing far from the strip and you can stay at hotel condos on the strip or close to it like the MGM signature. why would you stay here? the furniture and kitchen are were nice and big and i remember seeing a bath tub in a random part of the room. the sex room. hahaha.\n\nanyway after the tour she comes back and gives us a free lunch which was supposed to be \""amazing\"" but it was nasty. i could have crapped out a better lunch blind. plus the cookies were stale and the coffee was nasty. blech. \n\nshe gave her pitch we said no, she walked back and forth and gave us lower and lower deals and we said no. she said thanks and we go to another room with another man who looked like his job was to close deals we said no. he gave us a ridiculous deal that was way below what the other lady gave us. uh.... so is that what it's really worth? we said no. \n\nthen we go to another guy who has the \""chips\"" and he tries again but not as hard and we say no and give us our chips. he finally gives it to us and we go back to luxor and we realize the chips were the ones that we had to turn into real chips so we couldn't just cash it out. we play until we can turn them into real chips, cash it out, and leave, 5-6 hours later.\n\nI still talk about this experience to friends and it's a funny convo starter so for that i give it one more star. one star for the cash. zero stars for the food and sales pitch. blech.	0
Rain prevented us from golfing one day, so the four of us decided to get something to eat.  Heard there were some good Chinese restaurants in Chandler and didn't have a specific place in mind.  Just drove and happened on Sun Chinese.  My husband and I are Chinese so we know Chinese food and this was not it.  Not until reading the other reviews did we realize it was a \""Korean Chinese\"" restaurant.  Never heard of such a thing.  Maybe they do Korean well, but the \""Chinese\"" food we order was not good.  The waitress first brought out a small portion of  fried won ton strips w/ a sweet and sour sauce for dipping that were greasy and tasted like they had been sitting around for days. Hot and sour soup had way too much cornstarch.  Other main dishes also weren't that great and some of it was just strange.	0
Hadn't been here since they changed from Fado's, but I stopped in at happy hour for a friend's birthday. The appetizers were very good but here's the kicker...\n\n$9.73 for a tall Guinness... at happy hour? Who am I, Donald Trump?\n\nI'm sure I'll go here again, possibly for dinner... but I dont know who named it Happy Hour.	0
What do you get when an iconic NYC bar opens a second location in Las Vegas? Well, does it have a loud mouthy bitch in a low cut top serving drinks? Check. How about the big, fat doorman w/ bald head, leather vest and a long beard? Check. Will you hear \""Slowride\"" played at a mind numbing volume? Check Again!!!\n\nSo, what's the problem here? Maybe it's just the pretentious forced feeling that this place wants the reputation it didn't establish. Cool dive bars aren't chains. I don't think any of us think Applebee's when we tell people about our favorite neighborhood restaurant, but for the most part that's exactly what the Las Vegas H&H is. Sure it's got the look, the sound, plenty bikes and bad ass cars parked out front and no shortage of people playing the part, but it feels more like a production rather than a well earned atmosphere.\n\nI wanted to like this place, we've stopped there 3X but w/ so many bars in the Downtown area opening that aren't replicas of another location, you'll be like most and soon find a watering hole that better suits your taste. As one that spends a lot of time in Downtown, I'd say you'd never kick yourself for missing this place; but, if interest gets the better of you, you can always do what we saw most doing last time we visited: buy a drink, watch the bar theatre and pick up some Tchotchke to bring back to wherever your from to say you went.	0
Dumbbells everywhere. Not labeled. Smells a lil funky. It is a nice gym but just not maintained very well.	0
I've experienced much better.   I love food, I just LOVE LOVE LOVE me some food.  The food here is... meh.   I've been three times, and my general reaction is 2-3 stars at best for each of my visits.  Hey, can I get that without the green chilis?  No?  What about... can I get this with the sauce on the side?  No?  Can I...? Never mind, she just WALKED AWAY.\n\nAfter three visits with these folks, I have had a 100% consistent issue with getting seated- and this place actually earned its own tweet (I rarely tweet) because of the consistently snippy, unhelpful, and downright stand-offish response when we try to come spend our $400 there for a group lunch. So... two stars for consistency... that does seem to indicate a \""policy\"" and hooray for you, to be able to maintain such a strict adherence to your policies.  I guess. \n\nIt's unfortunate that there's one person on our admin staff that just ADORES this disaster of a chain, thus we end up getting dragged here for their annual \""work anniversary\"" lunch celebration.  No amount of calling ahead to see what can be done to make things go more smoothly for the staff at Oregano's (why wouldn't you want to know that a party of 15 is on its way?) and I've long since given up on trying to make things go smoothly for our staff.    I know you don't take reservations, I'm not trying to break your rules... I'm calling with a head's up to let you know that we have a group coming in 2 days from now.  And when I call ahead as they open that day to let them know, and I get the same defensive reaction.  Again, not trying to break your rules.  Just trying to see what CAN be done- but thank you for the thorough scolding on all of the things that CAN'T be done.\n\nThe rule here -*******take note if you're going to be with a group******- is that they WILL NOT SEAT YOU unless every member of your party is there.  That last person who stayed behind to lock the door and then caught the red light?  No, no, we can't seat the other 14 of you, that last, 15th, person has to be here before you can have your table.\n\nI've experienced this at the Chandler location once, in 2011... as well as the Gilbert location twice (once in 2012 and once in December of 2013).  \n\nWhen I was a kid (oh yes, I went there), there was a place in Phoenix called Ed Debevicks (I believe)... it was a 50's New York diner-style experience, complete with waiters and waitresses that would strive to exceed each other in the ways that they could be outrageously, hilariously, rude.  They'd shove you over so they could sit down while they took your order.  They'd loudly chew gum and take a sip of your drink.  They might call you names, they'd for sure snort and roll their eyes, but at the end of the day it was all a joke.  As they were putting on the act, they were covertly on the BALL with your order, with a new drink and refills, with getting your order correct and hot and on your table quickly.  \n\nOreganos?  Well... they're rude.  Aaaand... that's it.\n\nGood for groups: No\nGood when you need to catch a movie: No\nGood for work lunch (you have to be done in a reasonable time frame): No\n\nI tried to order Alfredo the Dark with one modification:  Nope. Can't do it.  Okay, that's fair.\n\nI tried to order the Lady is a Scampi: our server said \""It's spicy and we won't take it back if it's too spicy\"".  Well, I like to put sriracha sauce on my pizza, and I order my wings \""Hot\"" wherever I go, but she was so severe, I was worried about dropping $15 and going hungry for the rest of my work day. \n\nI have ordered a Julius Cesar salad with chicken (huge), which was good, but I've had better.\n\nI have ordered the Zany Ziti, and found it unbearably bland.  And I do believe pasta and pizza is like sex... even when it isn't the BEST you've ever had... well, I'm not going to complain.   But... really, really BLAND.  I thought, like some pastas, that it just needed a day to sort of meld the flavors, so I looked forward to having it as a leftover the next day, but it came in a breadbowl, which then rendered it inedible as a leftover the next day. \n\nI've had the thin crust pizza, which was fine.  I mean... *straining to say something nice* ...yeah.  It was ...fine.\n\nSo, kids, as much as I struggle emotionally with leaving a 2-star review... that's been my experience after three visits - and next year for my co-worker's anniversary, I'll wish her well and then probably head up Gilbert Road to Joe's BBQ.	0
Been there 3 times in 2 days been treated horrible.  Pass on this place & how they operate.\n1- They refused to honor their $1 off coupon on 2 occasions, then refused another coupon after they made the sandwich they said was good.   Complete morons and horrible service and treatment.  They switch to spanish and knew they were being even more rude.	0
This was our third stop during our Sunday bar hopping schedule. Typically, I read up on the places near by as we munch an appetizer and savor a tasty beverage. On this occasion we skipped that formality as the previous bartender said that Kona had great food and cheap happy hour prices.\n\nWhen we arrived, we quickly found two seats at the outdoor bar. I will have to give them a nod for places to people watch. Across from us was a Wilem Dafoe look alike in a black wife beater. He kept muttering to himself (I secretly suspect that he was arguing with himself). A couple of seats down from him was a dude that was rockin the full beach dude hair...party on bra\n\nOk back to Kona, happy hour drinks were ok, and they were cheap ($5), but the ultra lounge bartenders seemed busier than necessary. We finally settle on a sushi roll for our obligatory app.\n\nNow sushi is one of those dishes that takes a great deal of finesse and precision. You are basically buying about A cup of rice and some uncooked tasties for wrap and filling. Our roll was a happy hour special, so $5 for what would normally cost $10.\n\nWhat we got was a sad mangled roll. The pieces were so poorly cut, from the side it looked like a cell phone add showing how many bars you can get in this area. The taste was ok, if a bit bland, and the serving temp was decidedly too warm for sushi.\n\nOk, bottom line here folks, stop buy Kona for happy hour drinks, watch the carnival of lost souls huddled around the bar, and skip the food.	0
Expensive. Not that good... And they've charged me twice for \""extra guacamole and sour cream\"" that I didn't ask for. That's $2.50 each time. Enough to be aggravating but not enough to drive back for. \n\nI won't be back.	0
I got the fried rice with beef, and it was so-so.  I've had better.  The restaurant was decent andthe staff was friendly and fast.  But the food was just ok, and I have to admit that while I was eating it I was a little worried if I would get sick or not.  \nBut to be fair the other people I was eating with loved their food.  I heard the tempura vegetables were great.  Unfortunatley my experience was just mediocre. Thats the way it goes though, but  I will give them another shot , roll with the punches and try a different dish.  I'll keep you posted.	0
Food was ok. But the service was TERRIBLE. Our waitress lied to us about what our order consisted of. Then when it came out it was of course wrong. When we tried to reorder it they told us the kitchen closed, but their closing time wasn't for another 2 hours. Plus they were still serving other guests! Next, they told us they could remake it, but it'd be very inconvenient for them, since there was no chef. Ok wait... This place has an OPEN kitchen. I can see the cooks!!! And they're cooking!! Anyway... They finally remade it right. But this service was no service at all. They might as well have told me to cook it myself. Assholes. The only reason they're getting 2 stars instead of 1 is because when it was finally made the right way it's wasn't terrible.	0
Went there because we heard the food was great. If possible, the food was worse than the service. Sketchy looking building on the outside. Got seated right away. Ten minutes later out server came by. No mild salsa, actually nothing mild to dip your chips in.... If you get chips that is. Got our first batch and had to flag down a bus boy for some more. We had about 6 different people come to the table, none of which came by a second time. FINALLY got our food after what felt like 30 minutes. We were hopeful that the food would make up for the terrible service but we were sadly disappointed. Dry chicken, cold burritos, bland beans. Took seriously 20 minutes to get our check. The ONLY thing good this place has going for it is strong margaritas. SADLY SADLY disappointed and will NOT come back.	0
Here are my gripes with Tofu Hut: \n\n-The side dishes look and taste as if they were made weeks in advance.\n-The meats have that brown/gooey look to them, as meats tend to do when they're old. \n-The customer service is lacking, although this is expected from an Asian establishment.\n-The restaurant is filthy, which probably indicates the cleanliness of the food you're consuming. \n\nThe positives are that its well priced for a buffet and the selection of meats are diverse. You can order cow tongue if your heart so desires.\n\nOverall, I'd rather pay $5 more to eat at a nicer/cleaner/fresher spot. My friends do enjoy eating here due to the price, so I'm sure I'll be suckered into coming back, but not because I want to. \n\nKorean Garden and DJK are better options, although more expensive.	0
My daughter and I went here for dinner to celebrate an occasion that only happens once in a lifetime, Retirement, for me of course. She told me to pick out any place that was different and unique. I searched high and low and behold, II Vinaio.\n\nMy daughter didn't sound too pleased of my choice because of her culinary skills and wide range of unique eating establishments but she agreed and we arrived at our reservation time. We could have got away without the reservation.\n\nOur server was very prompt and recited the specials without hesitation, we selected the assorted cheese plate and alligator sausage with some kind of fritter for starters.\nThe cheese platter had an assortment of 3 different cheeses,olives,fruit,nuts,and not enough small toasted bread slices to accommodate all the cheese. The alligator sausage was good but was it really alligator sausage? Not that I eat it all the time,so am I an expert on alligator ? but it was good if it was gator. And any type of batter that is thrown into hot oil is always tasty, the fritter.\n\nThe cheese platter was good because the cheese comes from outside vendors and placed on a plate with the proper condiments how can you go wrong,a no brainier here. \nMy dinner choice was Crispy Prime Pork Loin over fontina risotto and caper berry sauce.That was another disappointment in my life .I also have a large repertoire of fine foods and this was not it. The plating would not have won an academy for best picture because the pounded out paper thin panko crusted pork cutlet was place on top of the dollop size portion of risotto and ugh. \n\nOur server promptly asked us how was the food and I told her that the pictures posted on this site sure didn't look like what I ordered. She told me that those pictures were posted a long time ago and things have changed. Well honey, that's the reason I came here, the pictures of the food were amazing.\nI've eaten pork loin before, not only in restaurants but I also cook a mean pork roast myself. This was not it!!! All I tasted was panko bread crumbs, where's the pork??\n\nLong grain rice (risotto) with melted cheese, I've had better.\nMy daughter has some kind of salad, just an assortment of greens with venison, nothing special.\n\nThe two glasses of Bordeaux were alright but were they Bordeaux? \nMy daughter should have paid the bill with a picture of a credit card and II Vinaio should have a disclaimer posted on their front door that reads, What you see you may not get.	0
Let me start off by saying that the only reason I'm giving this place a 2 star is because the manager ended up comping our meal at the end.\n\nSo, let's start with \""the good\"". The look of the restaurant is spectacular. It looks Italian, and decor is intriguing (esp. the lights over each table). If Yelp was based on looks alone, the Strand would be a solid 5. Too bad for the Strand that this is not the case...\n\nNow for \""the bad\"". The bad outweighs the good like a boulder outweighs a crumb, so let me put this in list form.\n\n1.) The service: We entered this establishment with no prior knowledge of it, no bias. After taking a seat, the four of us ordered our meals shortly after. Another family entered the Strand approximately 10 minutes after us and were seated at the empty table next to us. Their food was served to them 10 minutes before ours made it out to us. One of the folks in our party very specifically ordered their dish without mushrooms. It was brought out with mushrooms. Some time passed before we spotted our server (or A server for that matter) and catching her to let her know of the mistake wasn't an easy feat. Finally, the dish was corrected, though it was brought out after everyone else had:  finished their plates. And although the rest of our dinners were less than desirable, we ate most it because we were all hungry and there were no servers around to bring this up to.\n\n2.) The food: The mushroom thing; okay, that's an honest mistake (though the time it took to correct it was not), but even when they brought out the plate for the 2nd time, the rice was undercooked and crunchy, and it lacked any flavor at all. Everyone at the table tried a bite to confirm this. The pasta another person at our table ordered was overcooked and soggy, while the pizza my wife and I ordered was burned to a crisp. Of course, we would have complained earlier on in our visit if the servers were actually around and didn't dart out of sight as soon as you spotted them. \n\n3.) The overall experience: Chef Ramsay would have a heyday with this place. Aside from the food that makes one wonder if the chef themselves have ever actually tasted it, and the absent servers, the manager himself didn't seem to understand what constructive criticism is. When he finally came out after requesting him twice, he didn't seem to like what we had to say and tried negating our complaints with the fact that three of the four of us had eaten most of what we'd ordered (after we'd explained the server situation). He asked for constructive criticism, to which we explained that every complaint we had actually was constructive as he could use it to improve upon his business (duh.) He threw his arms up frustrated and said, \""Fine, you're meals comped\"" before storming off. I felt bad for a few seconds and then I suddenly didn't anymore. The food sucked, the service was terrible, and because of the terrible service we reluctantly nibbled on the sucky food. I'd have felt violated if we would had to pay for that craptastic experience. \n\nThis place deserves a 1 star review, but because of the manager's decision to do the right thing at the end, I decided to be kinder to their overall rating. I hope that the manager used our constructive criticism to make dining at the Strand more pleasant for future customers.	0
Anxious to see this new addition and knowing it was being marketed as the largest in the US., my family went on the second day it was open.  Admission for 2 adults and 1 child came to $52 and change, which made it more expensive than other local attractions.  Overall, we enjoyed the experience but it was not worth the money, especially when both the Phoenix Zoo and Desert Botanical Garden are a 15 minute drive away, both are cheaper, larger, provide much more to see and do for a longer period of time, and DBG has it's own Spring Butterfly Exhibit.\n\nOur son enjoyed the 3D movie, and throughout our entire visit, was the most educational aspect provided - although it centered around Monarch butterflies and their migration only.  The Chrysalis Lab, which you visit next, was the highlight of the visit.  However, there was absolutely no information provided aside from the paper tags identifying the types of butterflies in each type of cocoon.  Because you visit this area directly after the movie and the entire theater is emptied directly into this room, you really only have the length of the next movie to enjoy yourself before being crowded in upon by the next incoming group.  Due to my family being at the back of our theater, by the time the room cleared out enough to give us a good view of the cocoons, we had about 5 minutes or so and then were swarmed by the next large group of people anxious to get a look and were crowded out.\n\nThe atrium itself was alright, but disappointing for what was being boasted about it.  It was hot and humid, as to be expected, and the vegetation has a lot of growing to do before it can even be considered as rainforest-y.  The butterfly guide provided when admission was paid was both lacking quite a few species which were spotted, and listed a handful which weren't identified anywhere.  Aside from the few guides answering questions for children and marking their punch cards (they received a prize at the end for having a completed punch card), there was absolutely no information, signage, etc. provided anywhere...which was disappointing.\n\nThe ant colony and bee exhibit were alright, but have potential to be much better.  There were a few native AZ species in a corner that looked like they were thrown in as an afterthought and were out of place.  The fish seemed as an odd addition, and were nothing spectacular.  All very common species of fish found at any chain pet store and in the center of the room was a touch tank with 4 very small stingray laying on the bottom of the pool.  Only one came up on occasion, and the moment it was touched, went straight back down to the bottom.  Not faulting the stingray and wanting to be left alone, but a lot more could be done with that exhibit if they want to make it memorable in any way.\n\nOverall, a once-a-year-if-that sort of place unless you REALLY like butterflies.  It was expensive, and didn't provide enough for more than 1 1/2 to 2 hours of entertainment in its entirety.  Other valley organizations are cheaper, and have a lot more to offer.  I'll wait until the Odyssey Aquarium is built next to it, before ever venturing back over to that area.	0
I am sick to my stomach!!  I just had a bug on the lemon in my water.  When addressed with the manager Dan he was unprofessional and failed to provide any sympathy and or apology on behalf of the restaurant. He comped the POTATO CHIPS on our bill!!. I understand stuff happens however its the tact in how the situation is handled when something does go wrong that will make or break the after thoughts of your customer. I will NOT be returning to this restaurant	0
I really want to give NO STAR. This is absolutely the worst restaurant ever. No service. Had to get my own water jug to pour my own water.  and the food is absolutely horrible. i wouldn't call it chinese food. i wouldn't even call it asian food. It's edible. that all i can say.  It's a restaurant to fool white people who never had real chinese cuisine.  It's lucky its in AZ, because if this food court were in CA, it would never survive.  NO chinese ppl with a decent palate will ever walk into this imitation panda express which is worse than panda express.  i feel sorry for AZ residents where good cuisine is really lacking.	0
Wow! I'm stunned at the high average rating of this place. It found this place mediocre, and quite disappointing.\n\nThe fellas and I went to Vegas for the weekend and got three suites here. The rooms weren't bad, but they certainly didn't \""wow\"" me with their plush-ness. The worst thing about them was how dark they were. The walls were painted dark grey, and all the interior design was similarly color-themed. No matter how many lights were on, and with all the blinds open, the room was still dreary. \n\nThe buffet was good. Props for that.\n\nThe Brazilian BBQ at Rum Jungle was a letdown. See my review of Espetus in San Francisco for what Brazilian BBQ should be. At Rum Jungle, the food was okay, but the experience wasn't what it should have been. Rather than pick your own side dishes from a serve-yourself salad bar, the waiters decided what side dishes were coming, in what quantity, and how fast. Hardly the self-gorging experience Brazilian BBQ should be. Same with the meats. \n\nThe last straw happened when I went to hit the gym one morning. I walked up and was told \""there is a $20 fee for hotel guests to use the gym.\"" My head spun around. That's right, $20 for PAYING GUESTS to lift weights. Call me crazy, but I think that if an activity costs the hotel nothing, it should cost the guest nothing. Outrageous. Wait it gets better. I grudgingly forked over 20 bucks, and thought: this is likely to be the nicest gym I have ever been in. There will probably be strippers handing me my weights. Holy nope. This facility was a POS. I have been in nicer gyms in crappy apartment complexes. The whole place was probably 1000 square feet, with only 400 square feet devoted to weights. The place was lit by very dim fluorescent lights. Flattering. There was no free weight bench press. WTF? Talk about standard equipment! I was pissed the whole time, and I had a shitty workout as a result. I had dropped $250 in the casino that weekend, but that $20 hurt way worse. In the end, I protested to the front desk, and without contest, they reimbursed me my $20, so that was good.\n\nOverall, this place is mediocre at best. I will choose to stay somewhere else next time.	0
Slow slow slow...kept forgetting things, forgot an entire meal for one person in our party. Every request we had took at least 5 minutes. Horrible experience.	0
By far the WORST shipping experience ever. There were two people in front of me, each with one envelope and it took more than 30 minutes for them to get to me. Not only this but the Manager of all people asked the woman behind me what she was here for before even taking a single glance at me. The employees here are incompetent and unhelpful. Go to a different FedEx store if you want to make it out before you're old and crippled.	0
CLOSED!  AND THE BIG SLIDES REMOVED??\n\nNot sure what is going on here, looks to be some renovations I'll be totally bummed if they lose the big slides.	0
What can I say? Over rated to say the least !	0
I hate this store. I never thought that I could say this about a Target. \n\nEverytime I have been here, the police are Here. So frequent, that by the handicapped parking is specific parking for law enforcement only.\n\nThe store is really picked over, with no star bucks, petite baskets, and a lot of un happy looking employees.\n\nSomething about this store just feels dirty to me..and the feeling carries on to the parking lot. Baskets everywhere, trash, it really needs some TLC.	0
Stopped in for a slice of pizza - the sign in the window indicates you can get pizza by the slice.\n\nAnother restaurant in Pittsburgh that does not understand the concept of Air Conditioning. It was so hot and humid in here I was glad that all I ordered was one slice. The faster I could inhale it - the faster I was out of there.\n\nI asked what the options were for slices - I was told \""cheese or  pepperoni.\"" So I ordered one slice of pepperoni and got a bottle of cold water to go with it.\n\nThe pizza was okay - could have been more pepperoni for my blood, and the pepperoni was the very small diameter stuff.	0
We found a 20% off voucher in our room at the Palazzo so we decided to try this place out. They have outdoor as well as indoor seating. I would have sat outside if the weather permitted, but it was just way too hot. \n\nThe first thing I noticed was the ratio of employees vs patrons. There were definitely more servers and busboys than people eating so we had very attentive service. I started out with Kumamoto oysters on the half shell and my entr\u00e9e was Linguini Clam. The oysters were ok... not super fresh, but still good. The clam in my linguini were definitely not fresh though...It was pretty bland too... nothing to write home about. I tried some of the duck rillette. It was flavorful, but I just don't really enjoy items like that...\n\nIt was very convenient if you are staying at Palazzo, but I doubt I would come back since there are so many other options on the strip in Vegas.	0
Very disappointed! Not allergy friendly at all. They have six kinds of muffins - 3 with and nuts 3 without - but tossed them all together in the case so if you have a nut allergy you can't have anything! Seems thoughtless to me. The staff knew nothing about cross-contamination or ingredients! We did not eat anything and just left.	0
A little tricky to find.  They are behind the Fossil store.\n\nBasically these are standard cupcakes.  They do have some unique ones (such as pumpkin spice for Halloween).  I had a double-chocolate, and it was good.  But it wasn't $3.75 good.  I could do almost as well at home (I'd just need to learn how to do the butter cream frosting).\n\nAs I said, the cupcake was good.  But it wasn't GREAT.  And for $3.75 it should be GREAT.  But I suppose if you want something unique (like the pumpkin spice), it might be worth it to come here.	0
Order from ANYWHERE else but here. Seriously! Especially if you're thinking about ordering delivery. \n\nWeekdays - 2+ hours. \nWeekends - worse.\n\nIf you're starving real bad, can't think straight, hear your stomach making noises you haven't heard before... still DO NOT order from here!	0
I've been to Duke's three times now. When I first came to PGH, a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game, drink some brews and get great food. Most of that is true, but the bad has mostly outweighed the good.\n\nThey have an excellent new tap system. Last time I went, they had Thirsty Dog Leghumpper on draft, and it was perfect. The system really elevates already awesome beer. Plus, the selection is awesome. \n\nIt is a sports-themed bar, so you can expect drunk locals, loud TV's and plenty of yelling. I'm sort of into that, so it doesn't bother me, although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos. Service is often slow, and they give the waitresses ZERO training in the beers that they offer. This is not a good place for trying something new, as they can't tell you a thing about it. \n\nThe biggest downfall of Duke's, though, is the food. I've had three different, but equally simple, dishes there; A Burger, a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders. The first was flavorless and cold. The second was passable, but nothing special. And the last were absolutely awful. Honestly, the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill, I had to call it an early night. I ate two of the 7 tenders (SEVEN!) and had to quit. \nTheir fries are very good. And so are the wings.\n\nI'd say Duke's is a good place to drink, but that's about it.	0
Very annoying young staff yelling alot also in that whiny girl voice. Wifi and reception stinks as well. Not a good place to conduct business as they don't clean the tables or floors either. Damn..they won't shutup. Gotta leave.	0
I feel very conflicted writing this review. It's only my first time trying their food and I wanted very much to like them. Truth be told, I had attempted to place an order with Sakun Thai, but they told me I was too far from them to be within delivery range. I got off the phone with them, only to have them call me back and recommend that I try these guys since they were closer. It's quite an honor for one restaurant to recommend their competition, so I was willing to give them a try. \n\nHere's why I knock them stars; The food, while delivered quickly, was held in styrofoam containers with brittle plastic lids; lids which ended up breaking and contaminating our food. :{ It was well spiced and while the meat wasn't exceptionally tender, it wasn't leathery, either. We ordered four things, two of which had this problem [red chicken curry & tom kah gai soup].\n\n* Red Chicken Curry: Lots of bamboo shoots, chunks of chicken, bell pepper and the occasional bit of tomato. It was spicy but had the worst plastic contamination- we were only able to eat a small amount with very careful digging. When I called, they apologized and offered to make a new batch for us or give us a credit towards a future meal. I may take them up on it, but it will most likely be eaten inside the restaurant. \n\n* Tom Kah Gai soup: Chicken was noticeably tougher than in the curry. The soup had an interesting combination of flavors, but also had large inedible chunks of what I'm guessing were galangal- oh, and plastic. A decent portion of juicy mushrooms that looked yummy. Choking hazard a bummer, though.\n\n+ BBQ Thai Chicken: Really tender, juicy sliced chicken with the skin on. It seemed to be dark meat. The marinade had a good combination of aromatics that was accented by fresh cilantro. It came with a sweet chili dipping sauce on a bed of lettuce. One of the safe dishes and tasty. \n\n+ BBQ Pork Skewers: came 4 to an order, simple grilled pork that's coated in seasoning. It was tasty, but I doubt I'd order it again. \n\nOur overall total was $41-42. We've supposedly gotten credit towards a free dish, but we'll see how that pans out. The food arrived quickly and the cute delivery guy was very polite. It sounded like it might have been the same guy when I called about the broken lid and he seemed very upset and willing to make a new batch and bring it over right away, despite it being close to or after closing. \n\nLike I said; I really wanted to like this place. The service on the phone was handled well, the delivery was quick, the food tasted fine- but an error in the method of containment ruined the meal for us. I'd like to give them a second chance, but it will be inside the restaurant.	0
Every food show that comes to Pittsburgh focuses its lasers on Primanti Brothers. Man Vs. Food loved it! Diners, Drive-ins & Dives raved about it! Native Pittsburghers raise it to Untouchable status. In fact, it seems nearly sacrilege to live in Pittsburgh and not love Primanti Brothers.\n\nQuite frankly, though, there isn't much to love. I've lived in Pittsburgh for three years, and everyone who visits demands a trip to Primanti Brothers. So I take them. I've been more times than I care to admit, so I feel more than qualified to bash this place.\n\nI'ma break it down for you piece by piece.\n\n1. The Bread: Folks love the bread! It's thickly-sliced and freshly baked! It makes the sandwich unmanageably large, though; you spend more time mashing the sandwich into a fittable size than you do actually eating it. Additionally, the bread is so thick it overpowers the meat and sticks to the roof of your mouth in a most unpleasant manner. \n\n2. The Meat: Really bad quality. The \""steak\"" is worse than Steak-ums. It's actually worse than the rubber mats that line the floor behind the bar. Saying it has flavor is a compliment. And the \""Big Fish\""? Gag. Van de Kamps. If that. \n\n3. The Cole Slaw: Tastes like cabbage that's been soaked in vinegar. It has crunch, but that's about all it has.\n\n4. The French Fries. Meh. Bland. \n\nAnd all this is glopped together, sliced, and served, rather unceremoniously, on wax paper. \n\nMany see this as Down n' Dirty or Good Ol' Boy style. No Frills. Truly American. \n\nI see it as Not Much To Brag About.	0
With mountains of biology research in front of me, and the boyfriend busy with his own research paper, we decided to order delivery from here since neither of us was willing to abandon our work to cook for an hour. After repeating our address three separate times during the ordering process, were told that our food would be there in about 35 minutes\nWell, we waited an hour and a half. They had given the driver the wrong address, and when we finally got our food it was soggy and room temperature. Next time I think we'll take that hour to cook instead.	0
Donuts are a 5.   Drive thru and wait times are horrible.   Total cluster f$&k\n\nIt should not take 25 minutes to get through a drive through\n\nThe people are nice but their process is so inefficient	0
Not the worst airport and not the best.  I flew in on US Airways which they tend to cater to so it is also their largest terminal.  As luck would have it, I had a connecting flight that landed at the end of terminal B and my connecting flight was at the very end of terminal A.  To top it off, most of the people mover sidewalks were down.  Thankfully, I didn't mind the exercise and I had an hour in between connections.  Had my plane been late or the connection shorter, I would have been pissed at all of the maintenance.  The airport can use some updates and isn't the cleanest but, they at least have plenty of eatery choices.	0
Found an insect in my Chalupa. Don't eat here unless you're training for fear factor.	0
My husband and I decided to stop Friday night (Valentines Evening) at Denny's and have dinner since I was cooking our valentines meal Saturday night.  The restaurant was about 80% filled with guests and there were two waitresses, the manager and one bus boy in the dining room.  I never saw how many cooks were there but from the service I would have to guess ONE! \n\nWe were seated immediately by the manager and it took almost 10 minutes for a waitress to come take our drink order and another 30 minutes to get our drinks.  While the the drinks were being delivered the waitress took our food order.  I ordered endless soup and salad, and my husband ordered a ham and cheese omelet, white toast and grits.  \n\nAfter about  ten minutes or so the waitress brought me my salad  (brown, disgusting, limpy, dead) and about 5 minutes later she came and slid a bowl of soup (old, cold, canned) up next to me. I picked at my food while chatting with my husband thinking his food would arrive shortly, a half hour passed, I had been served my food, ate what I was going to of it and my husband STILL DID NOT HAVE HIS FOOD. \n\nI called over the manager and said I have been served my food if you could call this food and I am through eating and my husband still does NOT have his order. The manager said nothing, no apology, no offer to replace or fix anything he just scurried off into the kitchen and about 10 minutes later my husband's plate show up. \n\nThe omelet was cold, the cheese was not even melted, the grits were lumpy and definitely instant, the bread cold and soggy from the butter it was dunked in.  He ate a few bites and we got our ticket and went to the register to check out where the manager took our ticket, our money, he never once apologized or offered to fix or comp anything.\n\nNeedless to say I will be writing Denny's headquarter a very NASTY letter! For my fellow Las Vegas Peeps do not ever go to the Denny's on the corner of Eastern and Tropicana!	0
Not worth the price and I dunno how they are still open especially on nuns island! They have a competitor sushi palace just across!	0
The thing I always enjoyed about Aurelio's was that even though it was a little more expensive, you always got a much better product. Lately it seems that they are really skimping on the quality, and still demanding premium pricing. \n\nI used to eat Aurelio's pizza as a kid, it was always my favorite part of visiting family on the South Side. When I lived in Chicago I would regularly enjoy the lunch buffets in Evergreen Terrace and a few other locations. I also used to love watching games at the Cheyenne location before it closed. \n\nSo my aunt got me a giftcard for my birthday, and I figured I'd drive across town to check this one out, hoping it would be worth the 20-minute drive. When I called this afternoon, they said there was a dinner buffet tonight from 5-9pm, which was perfect, I thought, because you can enjoy a few different topping combos and some salad for a reasonable price. \n\nI drove 10 miles, and got there a little after 8. I walked past a giant sign on the building advertising the buffet on Tuesday nights from 5-9. I walked in, and there was no buffet. I asked the girl, and she said there was no buffet, went to the back and came back and offered me a special that was basically a small pizza for $12.99, and said it was the same as the buffet. \n\nI don't really know what they do for the buffet, or how much it costs exactly, but there are two mutually exclusive possibilities, either: 1) The special was the same as the buffet, which seriously undermines the quality of the buffet, or 2) The special was not the same as the buffet, in which case they were lying to me. \n\nIt says a lot about a place if they are not willing to offer you even the bare minimum that they are advertising. I understand that the restaurant was slow, and that's probably why they didn't offer the buffet, but maybe more people would go if they could count on the buffet to actually be there. I know I'm never going to drive 20 minutes for the mere possibility of a buffet again. And why do they only offer the buffet on Tuesday nights? Maybe people would come if they didn't have to think about what day it is before deciding what to eat? If you can get $13 per person for the buffet, are you seriously unable to offer it on every night of the week?\n\nThere is way too much great food and great value in Las Vegas that this place really doesn't deserve your business. \n\nI also just found a recipe for their sauce online, so maybe I can just make my own.	0
Not the best dentist office. Definitely had to wait some time before being seen. I appreciated the directness of the dentist on if I should be getting an onlay. In the end, in getting it or not getting it would lead to the same end result, a crown, so might as well wait. I typically go to a different dentist office in N. Scottsdale and they seemed to always push preventive procedures, like the onlay. The reason that I would return to the dentist in N. Scottsdale and not this one is because I felt the area where patients went looked dingy and dirty and I was very queasy about the dental assistant placing the x-ray bites in my mouth (used mouthwash like crazy when I got home!). Also, they made it seem like they were doing me a favor cleaning my teeth and the teeth cleaning lasted for a short time where it felt like they only cleaned a couple of my teeth. (Maybe I have really clean teeth though, who knows) The office I go to in N. Scottsdale uses a water pick thingy and they spend a decent amount of time going over all of my teeth. I will not re-visit this office again (as like stated above, I've experienced better) but I do appreciate the dentist's second opinion on having an onlay done.	0
This place sucks!!! I can hear my neighbor snoring and every word of their conversations. I payed more to be upstairs so I wouldn't have the noise problem...but it is still horrible. \n\nThey have bug problems. The door to the gym is broken anyone could walk in. Security doesn't do anything. \n\nThe management team sucks! At the beginning of our lease they told us we get 1 month free and could pro rate it throughout the 12 month lease. Making every month cheaper. So we did that. Every month I go into the office to pay rent they are confused saying that's not right and have to go check the files which takes way to much time. I've paid rent 10 times so by now they should understand what's going on. If they didn't want me to prorate the month they should have said that from the get go.\n\nThey are no help whatsoever. I've called to get the ice maker fixed. The AC doesn't work in the master bedroom and they still haven't come to look at that. The appliances are so loud. \n\nBottom line. I took the time to write this because you should NOT move into this place. For your own sanity go anywhere else!	0
Went in after along day of work to get a good pizza.. After watching the employees eat food with their fingers and not washing their hands after turned me off.. But thats not it..they had their own drinks on the same counter where the pizza crust lays..who knows what is on the bottom of those cups.. Dont even want to give them a star..so gross waste of 25 dollars cause we threw the pizza  away..	0
So food was decent but our server ( fat dude with a beard ) was the slowest server i ever had. I wanted to order so i called him and he said just one second, after 20 minutes i had to call him again. He even walks slow. I understand that it was busy but him not coming and walking slow makes me never want to come back here. I wish i had a different server. If anybody is reading this and coming here, make sure to avoid the table he is serving. I hope the management take action.	0
Worst place to eat EVER, are you joking, 18 bucks for fried rice and it taste like microwave food, the worst place ever. Its in mandalay bay and at lease they should hire an asian cook cuz I think they hire a white guy to cook asian food a triple thumbs down! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY THERE	0
We went here 2x. The first night was AMAZING. (The night before my wedding) then the night of my wedding after our reception we were all going to go out to celebrate. our promoter said he could get our party of 15 in. Our limo bus was late to get us and we were 10 minutes late for the guys to get in free (midnight). And we told our promoter and he said it would be fine and he'd get us in. We get there exactly 10 minutes late, tell the bouncer legit laughed in our faces told us that we couldn't get in unless the guys paid cover and we tried to text the promoter to help us out and they tried to heard us out of line and one huge bouncer shoved one of the guys we were with (who also was in a car accident and has back problems) and he looked at he manager who was there and asked \""are you really going to let your guy put his hands on me\"" and the manager said \""I didn't see nothing\"". Even tho he clearly did. My wedding night was spent at shitty bar on the strip when I was looking forward to being at this popping place. So I laid in my bed at the flamingo trying to fall asleep hearing the club going hard all night. It was such a tease :( I'm sorry for the low review but you guys need to get your people in check so your promoters give out accurate info. We would've been fine going in but the reason why it was an issue was with a $30 Cover the guys would've had less than $20 to spend on their overly priced drinks so it would've been pointless. Like I said if we would've known we'd have to pay we would've brought more money to get in!! It wouldn't have been an issue.	0
Price:  Great.\nFood:  \""You get what you pay for.\""\n\nThis place sports some pretty cheap food, allowing you to get a full meal for under $5, but it's too bad that the food here just isn't that great.  The hot dogs taste kind of weird (when don't they, though?) and their Italian sausages are only so-so compared to what I can get elsewhere.  The chicken strips are probably the best thing that I've eaten here, but that isn't saying too much.  Fries are available with pretty much every order, but unfortunately, they taste horrible.  They lack crispiness and don't make up for it in potato.  If you have a few, you'll know what I mean.	0
We had a pretty rough experience here. First off, two of the tapas we wanted to order were not available the day we went. And the ones we did order went from just ok to downright bad. \n\nThe Tortilla de patatas was just ok: there weren't enough potatoes in it, and the potatoes weren't thinly sliced as they should be. The aioli on it wasn't bad though, and we certainly did ok eating the whole thing. The Corazones fritos de alcachofas (fried artichoke hearts) were mediocre, cooked with a very heavy hand, and came out almost like a sports bar's mozzarella sticks but with artichoke hearts instead of cheese. All you could taste was the breading. Lastly the Croquetas de Verduras (vegetable croquettes) were prepared in almost the same way as the artichokes, with a balsamic reduction, but were very strange. They tasted like powered soup bouillon and the texture inside was very mushy. They were terrible, and we couldn't even eat all of them even though we were hungry for more.\n\nThe service was brusque, although the waitress comped the croquetas because we didn't like them.\n\nThe food might've been ok if I'd been really drunk, but sober this place leaves a lot to be desired.	0
This is my friend's favorite sushi place because they will make her sushi with just plain rice(not sushi rice). I tend to be a bit more of a traditional sushi lover so even though their roll list is impressive, the quality leaves something to be desired. I am not a huge fan but I have had worse. The fish is mediocre and only worth the price they are asking for when they run their happy hour. The drinks make the trip though. So if you are looking to have some drinks and a little sushi on the side, this would be a good place to go.	0
Not too many places in town that you can comfortably sit outside in the middle of our summers, but this place has an aggressive misting/fan system going on and we were so excited until the smokers came out and took over the patio. So we had to move inside, it was a Friday night and they were going to have salsa dancing later, so our server seated us in the dance floor area. We primarily came to watch salsa dancing and for some mojitos, but I am a self proclaimed high maintenance cocktail drinker, I don't do cheap wine or alcohol, so I was bummed when I saw they make their mojitos with Cruzan Rum, so our bartender suggested 10 Cane Rum which I never heard of but we agreed to a pitcher. My first sip all I could taste was soda water. Yuck, this isn't a mojito, this is soda water on the rocks. I didn't say anything to my friends at the table, 2 others said the same thing. So we decided to give the Sangria a try. We ordered a pitcher of red, when it came out, I immediately noticed the color, it was pink, like Kool-Aid, and that's exactly what it tasted like. If you mixed Ocean Spray Cran and Kool-Aid together, you would get their week attempt at Sangria. No drink left behind, that's what I've always learned, but these were the worst attempts at 2 of my favorite cocktails I've ever had. We ended up leaving both pitchers because none of us could drink them. \nI tried the mini Cuban sandwich, which was pretty good, as well as the plaintains, which is why this place is deserving of 2 stars. Our service was atrocious, so slow. I won't be returning.	0
I went in once for a cup of coffee, I thought it was over priced then. I went in again recently, only because we were with a friend that wanted to go there. I ordered a Chicken Cesar Salad and drink. It was good, but not $6.50 good. I felt bad for our friend, he likes it there, but as we agreed the lady at the register taking orders is, let's just say, less than nice and pleasant, which you need to be. He ordered a sandwich and side salad, she says, which one, very rudely. We went in a 1:30 and they close at 2pm on weekends... ODD... We do not frequent there, because their food is bland and overpriced, quite frankly I won't go somewhere, where people are rude. If you want to have that kind of attitude STAY HOME... It's not like there was a long line of people, in fact there was no one behind us. She had this hurry hurry attitude, I'm trying to close... I will never go back...\n\nOn the other hand, Mike was very nice. He saw that a few of us were trying to get refills before we left and the lady had already emptied the ice from he machine. He came over kindly with a big cup of ice and offered it to us. Thanks Mike!!!\n\nP.S. Front counter Lady, If you don't want to take 50% off coupons, don't offer them. She acted as if it was a total inconvenience...	0
Spotty service, plenty of patio space - and over 2 for 1 happy hour scam 2 glasses of beer was 13.08. Complete tourist trap. Should have known better.	0
So Ive been to this gentleman's club twice, not on purpose... \n  \nBasically to get in is free the guys just need to buy drink vouchers outside. \n\nThe girls were not that good looking but I guess its dark and with a couple drinks the dark room turns into somewhat of a looking glass where your watching it from the distance. Some of the women were going up to the guys who were buying bottle service but we just sat there with our cheap drinks looking at the main stage, \n\nall and all you get what you pay for.... not much.	0
Don't bother. This steak house wanna be in the Wynn Hotel falls way way short. My bone in ribeye cooked medium was tough and chewy. Was cooked properly but I suspect the marbling wasn't there. Stick to Prime or DelMonico's if you want good ribeye. We also had the potato pur\u00e9e which was way too \""watery\"". The creamed spinach was short on butter. The creamed corn was also watery but tasty.  Potatoes au gratin was OK, and my snow crab soup had a nice flavor but the crab was over cooked.  Nothing on the desert menu moved me enough to order any. That said, the ambience was fun, sit outside and watch the \""water show\"", that was the best part of the meal. But if you want steak, there are better steak houses, so move on.	0
Writing reviews is not an easy feat. When it is a good experience and expectations or needs have been met, there is the tendency to give it an exceptional write-up as well. Am not one to skimp on writing or spending the money or giving it less the time and effort for anything in this world. If it means to do something right or good for the benefit of mankind's satisfaction, there is the compelling need to let it be known. Restaurants and food places have to meet a great deal from each person's hunger satisfaction as well as the purse strings that purchases the meal. \n\nDined in this small restaurant next to a massage parlor in the shopping plaza at the corner of E. Flamingo and Algonquin Rd. in mid-April. Not many diners at that time. Menu is not extensive in choices. This restaurant skimped on authenticity of Chinese cuisine cooking, that is far from what one expects from Chinese cooking. For its cheapness in cost of a meal, it skimp or cut-back in ingredients! The noodles and fried rice were made of soy sauce and a little salt (maybe), devoid of the usual chopped vegetables and egg that comes with it. As you know it, the regular fried rice (or if it was for the combination meal) in almost every Chinese restaurant or in fast cooking or to-go Chinese restaurants as well, would make fried rice with the usual ingredients of chopped vegetables (i.e., carrots, peas, corn, or other type of vegetables are the staple to fried rice, isn't it?) and with eggs. Wouldn't you agree? How do you picture Fried Rice whether you know or not, or you are the Chinese cook? The usual idea and way of cooking fried rice is what anyone expects to be Fried Rice. The Curry Chicken tasted unlike curry with most likely the sauce itself came from a bottle of ready-made \""curry sauce\"" or chili-curry blend. See photo (thanks to a diner who was gladly took a photo of it) and regard it with your eyes if having less of ingredients means to have such meal at a cheaper price of $4.99 is sufficient. Is it a great buy for a combination of 2 entrees with plain noodles, plain fried rice at $4.99? It was disappointing to eat through the meal despite the affordability. In all accounts, a meal well-made is satisfying irregardless of the price it is afforded to. Sad to say, as it is decent in price but skimp on ingredients! Would you pay for less of a meal that's presented in a cut-back of ingredients? Had to mention that upon questioning how the fried rice and noodles were made as plain as can be, the cashier or man behind the counter stated that to have the vegetables and fried strips of egg in the fried rice and/or the noodles, an extra dollar is the extra charge or cost to the meal, thus would cost $5.99 (cost un-taxed). Such a sinker! \n\nExpectation: the usual Oh what a decent price for a combination meal with fried rice! \nUpon receiving the meal: Two thumbs down! \nRating: 2 Stars to 1 Star. \nRecommendation: Eat elsewhere for the price, the cooking, and the meal that is rrright!	0
Friday night was the second time I've visited this place. Atmosphere was nice, pretty dark, servers were very attentive but the food was not something that I would go back for. Especially a third time. Prices are pretty high but I was out with a friend and didnt have the family so that was ok. But the food once again was just mediocre. I ended up having the Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto. Sauce drowned everything out and made it very soggy tasting...The only thing that made up for the food was that I wasnt paying and my peach bellini (AMAZING)...	0
Always delicious. Don't miss the homemade root beer!	1
Best Atmosphere for any hour of the day for sure.  Every dish that I have ordered there has been fantastic!  The pretzel bread on their burger is amazing!  The only reason that I give 4 stars rather than 5 is the service- I have had my order messed up and it seems to take a little longer than I think it should be HOWEVER they are ALWAYS busy so that needs to be taken into account.  Maybe they should have another server on, who knows, I am not the management :-)	1
I'm not sure why, but it seems as if all of these \""sister hotels\"" end up falling a little bit short of the original. The Palazzo isn't as good as the Venetian, and similarly, Encore isn't as good as the Wynn. \n\nLet me start off by saying that I'm still a fan of Encore - the rooms are beautiful (5 stars!) and they have all of the fun stuff like XS, the Encore Beach Club, and Surrender. However, there's just something lacking. If you stay at Encore, you have to keep walking over to the Wynn anyway - all of the casual dining options are over there, and they have a larger casino that just feels more upbeat. \n\nI guess the best way to put it is this: Encore is great as an attachment to the Wynn, but it couldn't stand alone as its own hotel and casino. \n\nSide Note: They're good about safety! I lost my room key somewhere in the casino, and the rest of my group had left the hotel to watch a show elsewhere. Because the reservation wasn't under my name, the guy at the front desk wouldn't issue another room key for me. It made sense, so I didn't complain...but damn! I had no choice but to gamble some more. Two hours of roulette later, my friends came back and I was finally able to go back to our room...broke, of course.	1
What a fine place in dine in! It is rare situation to go to a restaurant with a group of mixed friends- and by mixed I mean meat eaters and veggies :) - and for all parties be happy with the quality of the food. I didn't realize that this place was so vegetarian friendly until I went out on a Friday night with some coworkers. The place was so awesomely designed that it feels upscale but also laid back at the same time. The people who work there know their stuff and are great at making suggestions- and I ended up getting the veggie sausage and chili- and everything was scrumptious. Coupled with a good beer selection and a few great whiskeys on the menu, this is a great place to get your booze and food on. The one not-so-good surprise for me was that the place was actually pretty quiet.... on a Friday night.  It's quite possible that things get a bit more interesting later in the night, but it did seem that the focus was more on the food and restaurant rather than the bar- which is great- however the next time I go I'd like to go a little later to make sure to be there when the action happens.	1
This place is great!  Food, cocktails and service exceeded all of our expectations.	1
Okay. Let me tell you something about The Bold Roost. It opened two weeks ago. Two weeks ago and it already is my favorite place in my area. You walk in here and the employees immediately treat you like family. Always asking me how I am with a smile on their face as soon as I walk in. I get my usual tea or caramel based drink and sit down. It's defiantly a coffee shop vibe here. Lounge chairs with wifi. Relaxing without a doubt. They have my drink ready quick and will always ask me how it is and tend to every catered need. As always, it's amazing. The best expresso of all time. People here are friendly and are up for a chat whenever. A great time whenever I come here. So, please, if you are looking for great customer service, amazing drinks, paninis, and overall an amazing experience come to The Bold Roost. It's just starting as an upcoming coffee shop and it's already amazing. It can only get better too! Overall, I'm proud to say my family will be a regular here for a very long time to come. Five stars and good luck Bold Roost!!!	1
*Dog park area review only*\nWe've been slowly making our rounds trying out dog parks with our new pup. So far this ones my favorite. The off leash areas were nice and big and the grass was well kept. Water fountain/faucet inside the run, which was helpful on the hot days.  Lots of friendly dogs and their owners. A couple benches are available to take a load off while your fuzzy one frolics. Separate areas designated for large and small dogs, but we noticed not everyone goes by the rules, which is fine by us, our pup likes all dogs. As with most parks not all the poop is picked up and some trash is left behind, even though there are plenty of \""doggy bags\"" and trash cans. But it is actually really clean.\nWe haven't gotten to explore the rest of the park but it looks large with lots of amenities.	1
Amazing!  Stop searching and go buy tickets!  I bought these last minute and couldn't have been happier about the whole experience.  It is as good (actually better in my opinion) than any Cirque shows.  Why?  Because it is funny, edgy, and acrobatic.  Also we waited until almost everyone had lined up and we still had great seats!!!!  It was truly entertainment at its best.	1
This rating is for our server Wanda and the food!!!  She did her best to greet her customers, clear the tables, take the order and serve her customer with a smile.  They are definitely understaffed, and I witnessed a manager reprimand another staff member in front of a crowded restaurant full of customers.	1
They're open year-round and they have the full DQ menu, though I rarely stray from the onion rings. I used to come here so often that I started to get paranoid I was becoming known as \""the blizzard guy.\""	1
I am a local here in Las Vegas but love visiting this mini mall over fashion show any day. Regardless of how pricey it is due to it being inside the hotel. I am very entertained with the different statues of greek gods and wall murals. It does not feel like I am in Las Vegas at all. Towards the end of the forum shops a mini show happens every hour, just a bunch of animated god/goddess with a story to tell. If you love The Cheese Cake Factory you would not miss it atl it. It is right there!!!!\nYou will also find the apple store, christian loubton, nike, h&m and many more other shops in here. But do not forget everything is expensive in the strip so if you want to save a little more, outlets south end of the strip and north end are available. \n\nTwo ways of getting in here from Las Vegas Blvd, either you do Valet at the main entrance where you check in or if you head out to the right side of Caesars you will also notice the valet for the mall. Head up north and you will see the self parking sign that leads right in the middle of the casino and mall.. \n\nAs a first timer you will be bound to get lost, I still do!! LOL! Caesars Palace in general is a big hotel. Or if you are lost employees are very friendly so dont hesitant to ask them.	1
Surprisingly not bad.	1
I met a friend for dinner here a few nights ago - some all you can eat and some Hockey on the provided TVs by the bar.  \n\nThe restaurant is nicely laid out.  The service is professional and well planned.  And the prices, with AYCE, are very decent.  The atmosphere was lively for a weeknight.\n\nThe popcorn lobster roll might just be the most beautiful thing I've found in a sushi bar in a very long time.  It will have me coming back for more of its delicious fried beautifulness.  I think this is something that this bar can call its own - that it has actually created something I'd never tasted before at a sushi bar.  And I think that says a fair amount. \n\nAlso, the fish was fresh and that is very, very important when you're looking to consume raw.  Good location and its definitely worth the walk in if you're in the mood for sushi.	1
I can't accurately rate this place as I was here when I was sooo tired, that I'm surprised that I didn't pass out with my face in my food.  From what I recall the burger was pretty good, the wait was pretty long and the place was a little dark.  That is about all I can remember from this place.	1
This is the top of my list of buffets at LV. We did the \""Buffet of Buffets\"" for $39.99 and this was our 2nd buffet of the weekend. Out of all of the buffets we've been to (Paris, Planet Hollywood, & Caesars Palace) this is my favorite. Their wide variety of food suits every appetite I had. What I also liked about this buffet is that it's quite roomy, not cramped and crowded like my other buffets. Their crab is fresh and pre-cut so you don't have to struggle and crack anything. I am a little biased because I love tempura, and this is the only buffet (out of the 3) that actually had shrimp tempura.\n\nOverall the food is great, however I only gave them 4 stars because their refills for drinks can be a little more quicker. Otherwise this buffet is great!	1
As far as Waffle Houses go, this one was pretty clean.  I enjoyed the waffle and their coffee was surprisingly good.   Our waitress was probably well over 60 years old and she was the hardest working waitress I have ever seen - she hustled	1
Everyone knows about Pei Wei right?! I really thought so until my boyfriend admitted that he had never been. Challenge accepted. \n\nNow, I've been a frequent Pei Wei customer ever since I discovered Asian food did not always have to send to you running to the restroom. (Yeah, thanks for nothing Bing Heng and Great Wall Buffet). This isn't the best Asian food ever, but it is quick, accessible, and always pretty tasty. \n\nI've tried everything on the menu, but my favorite options are the Crab Wontons and the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken. I ordered these plus the Spicy Korean for my n00b boyfriend to try, and everything went better than expected. \n\nIn fact, he even commented that the place was \""classier\"" than he expected. \n\nJust a side note: you can order and pay online, so you don't have to wait for the takeout line. You can also choose the specific time you would like to pick up your food.	1
Great service. Very smart and friendly staff. The manager and his team are the real deal.	1
I actually liked this course... maybe because I shot well on it, and that I went with some other people that paid for it, and I was on vacation and.....\n\nOk.. it wasn't a GREAT course, but the experience was good.   Probably a moderate level course that, as many vegas courses are, was relatively well kept up and wasn't that busy.	1
This is a wonderful place to stay in the Summerlin area of Las Vegas. The friendly and attentive service here rivals hotels with a much higher nightly rate. The rooms are modern and clean and best of all very functional. With access to a number of business areas close-by, there are quite a few really good dining, coffee and shopping options within a minute or two drive.  Will definitely stay here again the next time I am in the area!	1
We started with the arugula salad. Which i found to be very good. The price is high but what do you expect in Vegas? The food was good but it is a lot to be spending on food that wasn't anything spectacular.. Lasagna was okay the salmon was much better!!	1
I went to another Ultrazone laser tag birthday party recently. Rock on! \n\nSeriously, I have tons of fun playing this game. I learned this time that it is better to team up with at least one other person. This way you don't get nailed too many times (one covers the front, the other covers behind) and you can protect each other when you are trying to kill bases. Don't forget to hit them all cuz that's how you win the most points for your team!\n\nOnto the birthday party aspect though. IF (God forbid) I was a parent, I would totally want my kid's birthday party to be held here. My brother and I didn't have to do a thing. We sat there with the kids while the \""Game Master\"" served us and the kids pizza, drinks, and cake. \n\nAll of this for only $240 including tip!! That fed two adults and 13 kids with plenty of leftovers and 2 games of laser tag. Seriously...so worth it which is why I am upgrading to 5 STARS!	1
After leaving Seattle I went looking for a new tattoo shop to call my own, and though it took years, I've finally found it in Golden Rule Tattoo. The shop is simple and clean, the guys are all very talented and make you feel like family. Alex Empty has given me two beautiful tattoos and I'm working on some more ideas, but I wouldn't hesitate to go to any of the fellas that work here. I tell everyone I know to check Golden Rule out, even if you think you like another shop you owe it to yourself to see what else is out there.	1
Great location for dinner. Both the food and service was excellent. I would go again next time I am in Montreal.	1
It's not often I walk into a nightclub and think wow... the employees are really nice. I'm not saying they're giving you 5 star service, but at least they smile as they take your ID and tell you to have a good time.\n\nSome have mentioned the prices of the drinks to be expensive. Well... I didn't think they were any more or less than other venues I've been to that have music. $5 for a beer to me or less is not bad.\n\nI really liked the layout of the club. I liked the booths in the back where I could watch from an elevated area and not get into the mosh pit for Napalm Death and Devil Driver. Sound was pretty good and the bathrooms were cleans. The place looked much nicer than I'd expect to see a metal show. There were Ganesh statues, tapestry covers for the booths, ....\n\nThe place has good ventilation and despite all the smokers around me, I wasn't choking like I would be at the Double Down.\n\nOn Saturday nights they have a murder mystery theater thing from 6 to 8pm. I haven't gone but I can see where this venue would be a great place for something like this too.\n\nI liked this place enough to where I'd actively look to see what shows are coming to this place and come back again soon.	1
While pregnant I gained 50 lbs!..I was so embarrassed of the weight I had gained that I told myself I refuse to use my pregnancy as an excuse!..I've been working with meek bleek for awhile now and have since then lost 45 lbs!..I love his work outs and motivation!..I totally recommend this guy as he is genuine in his concern of getting you to where you want to be!..I couldn't ask for a better trainer!	1
Seriously the best BBQ in the area.  I like the pulled pork best.  I have also had the brisket, but it was a little too smoky for me.  I didn't even think that was possible, but it was.  \n\nChips and salsa are spot on.  You wouldn't think to order them at a BBQ place, but definitely do, they are well worth it.\n\nHands down favorite thing at this place: cornbread!  It comes out all warm and goey.  It has pork and whole bunch of other stuff in it that make it extra special.  The prices are unbeatable too.  Dinner for two, I'd be shocked if you spent more than $30 total with drinks.  \n\nI've heard the wait can be bad, but I was there on a Saturday night at 7pm and only waited maybe 10 minutes.  It was so good though I would wait much longer!\n\nHighly recommended!	1
Hello all,\n\nI've had the opportunity to visit three times so far and all experiences did not disappoint. The food quality is fantastic. It's great authentic food for a GREAT value. The Salmon and Tuna Ceviche is the best. And, the Carne Asada is very tasty and well prepared. My colleagues at my third visit had the Blackened Mahi Mahi and were indeed satisfied. I had a taste ant it was perfectly cooked and seasoned.\n\nThe service has been on par at every visit, particularly my second visit. This was a group birthday dinner on a Friday night. The guest of honor was running late and the host staff were very gracious enough to offer their office to store our many birthday gifts until all guests arrived. They also offered a better table that would meet our needs.\n\nSo, after three visits, when I am in Shadyside and hungry, I look forward to dining at Steel Cactus.\n\nColleen C.	1
Awesome food!  We walked all over, and this place had only a few minutes wait, we sat right next to the fountain 'outside' (inside the Forum) - Really nice.  We had 3 different pastas and all 3 were fresh and done very well.	1
I've eaten here a number of times. Tried a bunch of different omelettes and burgers. The volcano burger was amazing. Their breakfast buffet is delicious also. The bar service was really good, great drink selection.  I must say I was impressed for a hotel restaurant.	1
This is unequivocally the best attraction in town for children of all ages. Last year I came here with a six year old and we spent the entire day in the museum. She wasn't bored for a second. The only thing that happened is her grandfather and grandmother ran out of steam and eventually had to leave. Coming back again this year we were with a 4 year old and a 7 year old. Again, never a dull moment with tons to do that kept each of them interested and excited. There are three floors of different activities. Many of them are hands on. They are many diverse crafts to do. There's a grocery store. A auto mechanic shop. There's a place for construction. And there is the water area ( be aware, there is a real risk of getting soaking wet despite the fact that they provide rain ponchos for the kids). They do have hand dryers on the wall to help decrease the amount of water you take home but the kids really do get wet. At about $12 ahead, this is a real bargain. Highly recommended. I know I will be back again next year when my grandchildren come to visit.	1
Being hungry for Asian food in the south hills can leave one feeling a bit empty with the choices available, especially if you aren't in the mood for a belly full of cornstarch. Seeing that Mekong had Pho and good ratings, we were off to give it a shot. We entered a mostly empty restaurant with only a handful of tables and what seemed to be one woman running the front and back(I later found out there is another woman in the kitchen).\n\nWe were told to sit anywhere we'd like and immediately given water. We looked at the menu, standard american-chinese fare with some vietnamese specialties thrown in, including the Pho I had come for. My brother is a fan of General Tso's but wasn't exactly in the mood for it, so our waitress recommended he try the specialty 'Emperor' Chicken - apparently a bit more sweet and sour than your basic General Tso's. \n\nAlong with ordering, I indicated that my brother was severely allergic to nuts of all sorts, expecting to be given the standard response of 'oh, I'll check' or a vague 'they're cooked in the same area.. how allergic is he?'. No, the server, who referred to herself as Ma, explained that only two types of dished contained nuts, and that they were kept in a plastic container away from the other ingredients - completely reassuring us that no mix-ups could happen.\n\nThe food came out fairly quickly, the pho was hot but without standard items like sriracha and hoisin. No matter, the flavor was perfect, probably my favorite in the city. I was in the mood for spicy, so I did indeed ask for sriracha. She said she didn't give it because it gives the pho a lemony off-taste if you use too much of it, but that she could help me out. She went into the kitchen and brought out a small dish containing a finely sliced, bright red thai chili, warning a little goes a long way. I'm no stranger to this type of chili and throwing the whole thing in did indeed give me plenty of heat and burst of super-fresh chili flavor. I asked for a small bowl to share and she was happy to deliver that as well.\n\nThe Emperor Chicken was OK, full of large chunks of red and green peppers and onions if you like that - I prefer broccoli as my vegetable in dishes like that. It was bright and flavorful, though, and a large portion. Ma was friendly with us while we ate, asking whereabout we lived, and telling us anytime we needed to eat something good, just come see her.\n\nAll in all, this place has wonderful Pho. If you're trapped in the South Hills looking for something warm to fill you up, or just looking for a great family-run restaurant with friendly service and great chinese-american food, stop in and give Mekong a try.	1
Great spot to eat - I've been there a few times and I've never been disappointed! Its in the Venetian hotel, just downstairs from Tao nightclub so its really convenient for after clubbing munchies! \nThe menu is great - similar to the Cheesecake Factory. Their pastas are delicious! and they have a great dessert and drink selection. It's not a huge place so there can be a wait during busy hours, but the slots/tables are right next to it so you can kill time playing.	1
This review is pretty much just for the frozen hot chocolate I tried and all the delicious looking food around me as I ate it.  I had the peanut butter one and as a peanut butter fanatic it was soooo good!\nI also tried their walk up ordering outside and I was less than impressed with everything there.  If you go, go inside and order a frozen hot chocolate!  It is a bit pricey though	1
I love this place! I was there for about an hour and only spent five dollars. I love how they have old school games and even some new ones too. I don't think I can ever go to game works or other places. They just can't live up to this place. I even got popcorn for 25 cents! I'll be back for sure. :)	1
I have never really liked Hickory Tavern until we came to this location! Every time we visit this one the service is amazing (Staff is friendly, Mgmt checks in on your meals). When we have guests from out of town, we now always end up choosing Hickory Tavern SteeleCroft! Fave items to order are the Crab Dip, Salmon BLT and Tacos!	1
This is my go to chinese restaurant! I love the spicy mixed vegetables and the sweet and sour chicken. ITS REALLY CHICKEN TOO! lol\n\nclean\nfriendly service\n\nthe cooks in the back are weird, they stare!	1
Well well well where should I begin? !  \nDrinks? Ok.....\nMojito was made like no other! My fianc\u00e9 and I thought it was super fresh and yummy. I got a pickled pear (I think) supper tasty. \n\nAppetizer THE LOBSTER MAC &CHEESE!! MY FAVVVVVV. all I can say is you MUST try. \n\nEntr\u00e9e. My fianc\u00e9 got the steak I loved it more than he did only because of the cherry demi glaze not his fav but definitely mine!\nI got the chicken breast and my fianc\u00e9 like it more than me, funny how it turned out that way hahha but we loved how moist and flavorful the chicken was.\n\nOh and I cant forget about our amazing helpful everything you could ask for in a server MATTHEW!   He's Great!	1
We were in town for vacation with a group of 20 ppl.  One started getting ill and by the time half of us had, we figured we needed the cure all \""Wonton Soup\"",  LoMein with Beef, Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken with Broccoli, Crab Puffs and Potstickers.  This was the only place we found on Yelp that we could actually read the menu.  It also offered family sized pans and was very reasonable.  We drove the 25 minutes to find it and our order was ready.   Soup was more like Special Wonton and LoMein and other dishes above were all very good.  Staff was a little sparse on Sweet n Sour Sauce, but we weren't feeling well so didn't feel like asking for more.  The food was really very tasty; worth the drive and heated up leftovers were very good too.   For 20 ppl our order was about $128.00.  Good price, taste and quality.  Glad we found it.	1
Pretty legit. They sell some really cool and interesting things. They even have a little zombie shooting range which was entertaining. They even let you try out the stun guns. My friend had a stranger try the weakest taser on him and he barely felt anything - but it was funny to watch! Staff is friendly and helpful.	1
I can't wait to go back again.  My Sister and I came in for a late lunch, and we really enjoyed everything.  I had the cucumber honey lemonade and it was so delicious.  We shared the pub board with pretzels, mustard, sausage, cheese, and pickles.  Oh man, it was so good. The pretzel was amazing, really really amazing and the mustard was soooooo freakin good.  I had bruchetta (fig, marscapone, prosciutto; burrata, bacon, argula; caprese; and goat cheese roasted red pepper) and they were each amazing, I almost couldn't decide on a favorite.  I spread a little mustard on the goat cheese red pepper one and it was great!! I tried my Sister's sandwich and salad, she had the nine iron and it was one of the best panini's ever!! The salad was sooo good and cheesy and yummy with the pine nuts!!  We loved it all!!	1
Great place to grab lunch. We walked in on a Thursday afternoon and were seated in less than 10 minutes, and that's awesome because this place is always packed. The hostess was very pleasant and took our drink orders right away. Our waitress was at our table to greet us in less than two minutes and kept coming back to make sure our drinks were filled and that we were enjoying our meals...and she was very cute! The food was great; Black Forest Ham Omelette for my sister, basic eggs and bacon for brother-in-law, and I had Prime Rib sandwich with au jus. Very delicious! Will come back for sure!!!	1
I have used this company for several years.  They always do a great job.	1
This place is seriously good. Come later at night if you want to get in without a reservation. The drunken noodle seabass was the highlight for me. Servers are excellent and you can always trust them to order for you (I did this and it was fun trying new things. Great old Riesling wines that contrast the spicy amazingly. Have to order the mangos for dessert.	1
Love it!  Great food, prices, and service!!  Would recommend for dinein or takeout.	1
Wowzers ... I was recently in Vegas and had my first stay at the MGM Grand Hotel. The first food I had during my stay was here at Wolfgang's.  Probably some of the best food I can remember eating in Vegas. I ordered the prosciutto pizza which had kalamata olives, oven-dried tomatoes, goat cheese and a drizzle of basil pesto ... This was heaven on a plate!  If you've read my other reviews, you know I have a serious relationship with olives, especially on my pizza. Mmmm....It was delish! My friend had the half chicken and it came out looking pretty amazing as well.  I thought prices were really reasonable (considering it's Vegas and in a hotel) and service was good.\nI would definitely make an attempt to eat here again on a future trip to Vegas!	1
Sometimes I feel like I went to a different place than everyone else.  I've been there a few times and there was never live music, I've never eaten their food - or been offered a menu so I didn't even know they had food until I saw it on Yelp reviews, and I've never had any wine.  Ok, so the wine is my fault - I'm one of those people who wont have a single drink if I'm geting behind the wheel and since this was a place we went after work, I was always driving.  I worked right near there and we went by about 5ish - right after work.  Both times we were almost the only people in there. And it had soft natural light coming in from the windows.  I liked the background piped in music, but it wasn't anything to write home about.  And since there were no wait staff, we sat at the bar each time - though the chairs sure looked comfee.\n\nSo the bartender was always nice, but this is such a dramatically different Kazimierz that I almost hesitated to review it.  But then I started thinking it might be worth it for those who wanted a nice, relaxed casual spot for drinks ater work since no one else seemed to be there at the time.  \n\nAnd since I haven't seen this mentioned anywhere else - Beer and wine only.  A friend tried for a Whiskey sour and was quickly turned down.  Important to know when taking your friends to a bar.	1
Oh Lee's Liquor.. what can i say about you guys. Where else can you find refrigerators of beer not found any place else in Las Vegas.\n\nFound this place via my Yelp app. Its pretty far from the strip but I was doing errands around the area anyways. I stopped in and found out they carry Shiner Bok. which is my all time favorite beer thats brewed in Texas but for some odd reason, we found it in Vegas. Finding that here made my trip to Lee's soo much better.\n\nPricing was also cheaper than what you could get it in TX for. Their pricing for sure i on point. Their 750ml grey goose was one of the cheaper places I've seen ever.\n\nEveryone is saying that this store is one of the smaller locations but they for sure have everything you need in terms of getting your drink on!	1
Great service and they were super fast! \n\niRepairs fixed my phone in about 30 minutes. In and out and they were extremely friendly.	1
My friends and I finished up our beer tour here two weekends ago! NoDa was the place to be, and everyone knew it. We enjoyed a tour of the brewery. The guide was informative, funny, and corny in the right places. After the tour, we sat outside for a long while and just relaxed. The atmosphere was amazing, and you can tell they take pride in their brewery. There was also a food truck outside, which had good fries and fried clams. My husband absolutely loves NoDa's beer, especially Hop, Drop, and Roll, so I know we'll be back! :)	1
I've not had any treatments before this.  I was pleasantly surprised at the outcome. First treatment Juvederm and Botox. With the Juvederm the results were instant. Botox a few days later. I was very happy with the results. Why plastic surgery when to me this works quicker with no down time?I will definitely recommend Charles to my friends and clients.	1
Vientiane Palace is great as a lunch location (it'd probably be good for dinner as well). Portions are fairly large. The spiciness is something you can ask to specify with many dishes. While I've one one or two occasions had something that turned out more mundane than I expected, usually the food is excellent. I concur with Sarah that the service isn't bad, just \""business-like\"", although I confess I've never eaten here with a guest, just by myself. Which doesn't mean anything, since the food's good enough that I'd recommend to anyone who generally likes Southeast Asian cuisine and wants to try something new.	1
PBR on TAP I am down!!!  Pizza is good.  Just make sure you have it there the crust gets to soft when you get it to go.	1
Went to eddies last night for lobster mania every thursday-saturday threw labor day!! Any thing bigger then a 1-Lbs lobster maje sure to order ahead!!\n We ordered ahead of time our  2lb lobsters they were  fantastic with a wonderfull pairing of corn hush puppies and salade \nFor an appitizere ordered,  the new featured special  steak tartar, its unlike anything ever related to a traditional steak tartar. wonderfully seared fillet mignon cooked rare and ground surved with a pita bread a truly wonderfull delight.

Great option when you need to feed hungry kids and don't have time to cook dinner. I always ask to wait for a fresh hot n ready pizza so it's nice and hot when we get home. I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes for them to cook a fresh pizza, as they are continually making them. \n\nOnly cost $5, and I prefer this pizza over greasy Pizza Hut any day.	1
This is an authentic Irish pub! I had the Bellybutton, wonderful! can't wait to go back!	1
My new favorite breakfast place in town. I like that you can go healthy with bananas instead of potatoes and egg whites in almost any of the dishes.  My favorite healthy item is the power wrap with chicken, egg whites, and salsa in a wheat tortilla.  If you are looking for more traditional fare you can't go wrong with chesters way (their version of corned beef hash) or even just the classic with bacon (always crispy) and the buttery potatoes.  If you want a bit of everything go for Jacob's slammin platter.\n\n\nAs if the food wasn't enough to keep me coming back the service is top notch.  Very attentive and friendly.  Go there a few times and they start remembering your drink order.\n\nDon't be alarmed if the place is busy.  It may seem like it will take forever but they turn tables there very quickly and they'll bring around samples to taste too.	1
I love Firefly. This is one of the few restaurants where I have a hard time ordering because I love so many things on the menu. \n\nThe sangria is great. It's an absolute must. I love both the white and the red.\n\nWhen it comes to food, you pretty much can't go wrong, no matter what you order. And despite being tapas, the portions are actually pretty generous. Because there are so many options, I try to change up my order every time, but I always bully my friends into sharing an order of the fries (which are amazing). \n\nAnd if you somehow manage to save room for dessert, the banana nutella sandwiches are highly recommended. \n\nMy only complaint is that it can be a little bit loud at times.	1
I had such a great customer service experience with Inglot at the Forum Shops I had to write about it.  I've been seeing these products all over youtube and seeing how great they are.  I liked the wide variety of colors so I had to have some, however, the closest store was in Miami.  \n\nI found out through word of mouth that Inglot ships directly from the store.  After a horrible experience with the Miami store, I called the Vegas store and was given an email address: TheForumShops@inglot.usa.com to send the request to.  Reluctantly, I sent the order and was given a call the very next day by 10 a.m and the guy I talked to was awesome.  He was very friendly and well verse in product knowledge.  I ordered 20 different shadows, 2 gel liners AND A brush.  All the the products I requested WERE IN STOCK!!  Plus, free shipping YIIIPPPPEEEEE!!  GOOO INGLOT!!  You're probably thinking that's how it's supposed to be however, the inglot Miami experience was not that great.  I wish I had his name because I'd be giving him shine in this review.   I'm happy with the Inglot Las Vegas store and sadly I can't visit.  I will update this review when I get the products.  The customer service was awesome!	1
Great new Mexican food! Great service!  Brad was our waiter and he was very friendly, prompt, helpful and had good food recommendations.  The salsa is very spicy but very delicious.  Try La Ristra!!!	1
My family started coming here after Dr. Cheng was recommended to us by the surgeon who performed my husbands appendectomy a few years ago. I really like Dr. Cheng. He listens, answers all my questions and is very thorough. I have been impressed by the other doctors here as well. I like that they have a same day/next day appointment policy. I know that if I have a sick kid I can get in right away. My only gripe is that they don't have an x-ray machine. I've had to take my kids to expensive urgent care twice now because of this (2 rowdy boys).  I don't know if that is typical of most doctor's offices or not but I wish I didn't have to go to urgent care.	1
Nice, spacious Crossfit facility located in the lobby of The Springs Church. \n\nCoach Dairus Barnes and Jarom Prows were awesome to give my Coach and I a new training home (after being ousted aka training times cut from our previous facility) back in July. We're stoked to represent them through sponsorship! \n\nAs I've said many, many times, I'm not a \""Crossfitter\"". I simply use their bumper plates and bars to train for hammer throw.\n\nHowever, the programming at CFC seems to be exceptional. There's a great community of people that train at this box that have welcomed Coach and I with open arms.  I truly enjoy working out with this group of people and look forward to Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday! \n\nCoach Dairus is a riot, and I forgive him for being a CU Buff fan. \n\nFrequent \""Outside of the Box\"" WODs (Workout of the Day) on certain Saturdays: Think hiking, volleyball at the park, etc. \n\nDon't forget team happy hour at Zipps from time to time! \n\nOh so Olympic Lifts are complicated and dangerous? Yes, but never fear! Coach Shawn Hanrahan (my coach!) regularly puts on weekend 3 hour, hands on Olympic Lifting Seminars. \n\nHe's been doing this for years, USAW Certified, trained by Meg Ritchie (look it up). Also a top Masters Olympic Lifter. Boom!\n\nYou won't find the monstrous egos you'll find at other CrossFit affiliates throughout the Valley. *ahem!*\n\nIn fact, some of the lowest tuition rates can be found here. I believe it's $75-$95 a month for unlimited classes. \n\nThe only complaint I have is no squat racks are here . . . yet! \n\nIf you want to improve your quality of life through functional fitness, climb off that couch and ditch your fast food runs! Come check out CrossFit Crew today and have a chat with Coach Dairus.	1
Especially if you can get half price tickets this is a great deal for this Medieval Times Knockoff Show. \n\nIt makes it an even better deal because you get a meal too, which, hey, 'free' food, awesome!\n\nYou get exactly what the show advertises, which I like. No secrets here, just jousing and kings and food and horses. \n\nLotsa fun.	1
Staff was friendly.  the rooms were small, but sufficient. It was clean and comfortable.   Breakfast was excellent and staff very friendly and helpful.  Internet and WiFi was free and powerful and reliable.  centrally located.  near the Edinburgh castle and downtown.  I would stay here again and again!.	1
