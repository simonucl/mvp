Normally I'm impressed with Apple Store customer service. This location sucks. Every interaction I have with the staff here is rude. The girl \""helping\"" me with an exchange was asking me how to do it. Good thing I was there to help. 2 stars only because they are efficient. That's all.	0
I remember I went to this movie years ago when it was just a regular theater. Then I went back about a year ago and saw the changes, it was awesome! They took the iPic concept which I love! We watched The Vow and reclined and got over prices mediocre tasting food. But I still loved it! So I wanted to have my boyfriend experience it as well since he liked iPic.\n\nWe went and got tickets for Safe Haven (I'm a total chick, I know) and I didn't care how expensive the tickets were because I knew what to expect for that price...my expectations were shot to tell! We sat in a theater where the chairs didn't recline and were uncomfortable. And it pissed me off even more that they had waiters in there because that's the reason they were over priced. If I'm gonna be in a regular theater, then I have no problem with standing in line at the concession stand. Needless to say, it was disappointing. \n\nDo yourself a favor and go to iPic.	0
One star because the bowls are delicious. Other than that this place is horrendous.  Slow as all hell, pretty much get your order wrong every single time. That's if they even remember to make it.  Usually you wait 15 minutes before finally saying something and they realize they forgot to make it in the first place.\n\nMost unorganized operation ever.  If they didn't essentially have a monopoly on the Tempe Acai bowl market I'd never go here.  Their employees deserve less than minimum wage.  Oh and it's overpriced.	0
And yet again the same cashier, middle-aged guy with light brown hair plays stupid with me. \""I can't do split payments.\""  Dude, you've been at this store for 13 years. I know because I've complained before. You're rude. Unprofessional. Not worthy of my business.	0
Please go when it is $2.00 days, that is about what it is worth.  Make sure you eat ahead of time.  Very limited food venders, and no variety.  I will say last year was much different, and  a lot of fun	0
I have been to the Strip location of the Pittsburgh Popcorn Company and I would give that location 4.5 stars. \n\nToday I ran into the Oakland location which I hadn't visited prior. When I entered the location was a mess. It looked like behind the counter had not been cleaned in a while. I am assuming that this was because of the business of the location, but the Strip location appears to be much cleaner. \n\nI purchased two bags, one of the chocolate caramel and the rice krispy. Both were good. My only concern about the product itself was my bag of rice krispy was had other types of popcorn in it. When I ordered rice krispy, I wasn't hoping to get cheddar or dill pickle. \n\nI would suggest that if only is coming to Pittsburgh Popcorn Company for the first time, go to the Strip location. I	0
I wish I knew about this website a few months ago. \n\nMy family and I had great experience at other cheesecake factory. This location was a total upset. We made reservation ahead of time for twelve people and the staff rest assured that they can accomodate that much.\n\nOur reservation was supposed to be at 6:00 pm, but we weren't seated until 7:00 p.m. At this point, the men in the family were all upset, but still had to go in, for the sake of the ladies. So we followed the staff to an area, but only to find out that they didn't have our table ready. We were told that we will be scattered or to be sitted in different tables...even though we had a party of twelve. By this time, I was really angry. I wasn't able to hold myself in, I freaked out. They were supposed to find a way to meet our needs. Like they say, customers are always right. But the unorganized staff didn't deliver at all. Everyone in my family were upset because of what was going on and we were suppose to have a great time since it was my daughter's birthday. Anyway, as mentioned the staff were just horrible. We didn't get our drinks in a five minute time frame, but instead longer. It took us even longer to order and to get our food. The most irritating part, they messed up on some of the orders and didn't even apologize. Since I am very carefree, I asked one of the staff for the manager. I told the manager that we weren't happy and that, he had the worst staff any person can imagine.Out of all the cheesecake factory (at the ceasar's forum) staff, the manager, I believe was, the only one who was decent to actually care about his job and the reputation of the restaurant. \n\nSkip this place when you are in Las Vegas. The worst restaurant ever. I would rate this place half a star.	0
I was really excited to try this place, they brought flyers around our office building for the past month now.\n\nI called in an order of 2 chicken gyro lunch specials, regular gyro lunch special, & falafel pita with greek fries, & was told to pick up in 30 mins.  Reasonable time for an order that size.\n\nI got there about 15 minutes after I placed the order and the food was already packaged up ready to go.  The \""waitress\"" had quite a difficult time ringing up my order, ended up giving me $2.00 off the order total, because she was confused about pricing?\n\nMy drive back to the office was a total 8 minutes.  Weird, because the french fries in each order were so soggy & nasty, they couldn't be eaten.  Not to mention the fact I paid extra for the greek fries & didn't get greek fries.  The falafels in the pita were hard & dry, to hard to eat.  The gyros were nothing to talk about either.\n\nI really wanted this place to be good, again I was so excited to try it.  I love trying local neighborhood family eateries, but  I really don't think DJ Hollywood's will see me again.	0
Great service by Allison; TERRIBLE food!  Took over 40 min to get awful, cold food.  Spoke to mgr, who never came to table, and only offered dessert as compensation.  \""Banana muffin\"" was vanilla cream cupcake?	0
Been eating out lots and lots and lots lately.   I have had such good luck with Yelp, but have had more than one less than positive experiences in the past few weeks with highly, highly recommended restaurants.  I hate to give a negative review, but if I had read anything close to what we experienced, I would not have spent a lot (a lot) of money at Eleven.\n\nI am originally from Pittsburgh and now live outside DC.  My husband and 2 sons (age 19 and 16) Went to Eleven solely based on Yelp reviews on a recent visit to Pittsburgh when we were able to take some time away from family events.  I love the Strip, so we  headed to Eleven which, Yelpers, sounded great  - people talked about cozy booths and wooden beams, etc... I was, therefore,  unprepared for the dark, stark, industrial nature of the place.  Yes, it is in keeping with the city and the vibe of the Strip, but I found the whole place to be loud, cold and impersonal.  Opposite of cozy.    \n\nThe worst thing really was the odor that hit us as we entered.  Kind of a whiff of wet garbage, maybe?  All 4 of us smelled it immediately, and it was not inviting.  The hostess looked at us like we were crazy.  We had a drink in the bar. (There are TV's.  Why?  ISn't this a classy place?)\n\nSmell was in the bar, and in the restaurant but fainter.\n\nHonestly, I don't even remember the specifics of the food.  A lot of it was tasty, for sure. All of it was overpriced for Pittsburgh.  I've been in so many similar restaurants in major cities, I guess Pittsburgh is just catching up.  Maybe I don't like seeing the generic pretentious foodiness in a city that is famous for fries on sandwiches?  That's my problem, for sure.\n\nIt was expensive, by any measure.  I was actually angry I spent so much on an experience that would have been considered highly average where ever it was.\n\n\nIs this a chain?\n\nI would give it 2.5 stars.	0
I went here with a couple of friends and their sangria is to die for.  I love their sangria so much, it is so delicious and kind of liked that it was dead to when I went.  The only thing I didn't like is we ordered appetizers here and they were hardly appetizers.  We ordered 3 different appetizers to share and 2 rounds of sangria pitchers for all of us combined.  We were going to share everything completely.  But when the appetizers came they were tiny, and I mean you get one bite each.  It was like a miniature sampler almost.  And when the bill came I just about passed out that 3 little appetizers and sangria could cost well over $100, and I do mean OVER $100.\n\nI understand it's scottsdale but if you saw the prices for that volume it's just too insane.  For that same $100 I could have gone to Buca Di Beppo in scottsdale and skipped the appetizers and got a pitcher of sangria and actual food for half if not one third the price.\n\nOtherwise the bathrooms were clean, the staff was speedy and friendly, and I loved sitting outside but those prices are so much I'd say only go there for drinks and to hang out. Get your food elsewhere.	0
-Organized inside. Smaller than other Goodwill stores.\n\n-Filthy, dirty parking lot...small too. Rugged with pot holes. YIKES!\n\n-Good prices. Friendly employees.\n\n-It's hit or miss on what treasure you might find at this location.\n\n-Park on the north or south side of the building - the entrance faces west. Handicap parking is on the north.\n\n-I have been in this Goodwill many times and have NEVER found anything.	0
Terrible. Me and my hubby went here back in Jan for our anniversary. We waited nearly 2 hours for our food. When it finally arrived, it turned out that they had run out of the Lamb my husband had ordered, and they brought him some pasta plate to compensate for it. And after all this, they didn't even offer a discount on our bill. Never eating here again.	0
OMG WORST SERVICE EVER.\ntook a cab out from the strip bc of the great reviews.. should have just ate the noodle bar in caesars.  \nordered a tremendous amount from the menu...i expected more dim sum for dinner but they only had a few selections and the ones we chose were out... \nhad chicken feet... i didnt eat but heard it was amazing.\nfried rice was dry.\nthe dimsum we did have was good though..\nchinese broccoli..i personally dont like so i cant really review it..\nIMO, dont waste your time unless youre already tehre	0
Cheeeeziest place to spend time, along with ELI's. Same people~ but different names hang out at these 2 places. Crappy drinks and the bar staff put other peoples drinks on your bill. YIKES!  One of the Bands that plays there is good~ but mainly too loud. This place made me want to go back home, lay on my sofa , take  my TV  remote control and watch Celebrity rehab! The people who frequent this place are ...ummm....ummmm WTF where in the world are they from? Gross! The food slides off the table either alive still or greasy and nasty...my chin got 'moisturized' eating that crap. I ordered a vodca cranberry and got a super red #4 carcinogentic something.. that looked like coolaid and tasted like rubbing alchohol and nail polish. I think the word 'eeeew!' is the best word to describe this low class bar...and sorry....I am jumping out on a limb here but..the people are pretty darn ugly and drunk that I saw there. I saw a woman's naked crotch in there, and a guy rubbing himself in there. HEY! Don't kill the messenger..I'm just sayin .	0
Horrible. From the price of juice and milk for kids to the moldy grapes that laid on my food and I mean white mold. Disgusting. Lost my appetite. Service is very very slow and there was only 5 tables. For a place that had steak in their name my daughter did not eat her steak and eggs as it was a horrible peace of cheap sirloin. We live a block a way and will never go back again.	0
The girls who work here are wonderful, friendly and kind.  Sadly, they sell an overpriced product.  The only thing I have ever gotten from Torrid that hasn't immediately fallen apart are their shoes.  (Not the ones on the hangers, either.)  This is a nice store and it seems well kept but I just can't bring myself to purchase anything that's not on the clearance rack because I know it's going to turn to a big shadoob as soon as it's washed.  Yes the stuff is trendy and if you have money to throw away on a wear-once shirt this place is for you.  The quality is reminisce of a Fashion Bug, but at least there you know it's not good and the price reflects that.  Torrid is like your frienemy with the big ego.	0
Paid money and they never showed up - waited for hours and no answer on the phone.  They are scam artists!	0
Major disappointment. Either Gordon Ramsay's shows are a fake ass front or he needs to get over here to BurGR and get things in order the way he makes it appear on tv. Having eaten at his pub and grill before and having a great experience I didn't think BurGR was going to be the way it ended up. The wait was 2 hours to get a table and once inside it took forever to even get our order taken. The jalape\u00f1o poppers we stared out with were terrible and I've had better at. sonic. The inside was still cold. Unfortunately cold food seemed to be the theme of the night. Our fries and onion rings were brought out cold. My burger was cold and flavorless while the hot dog I had was just ridiculously too big for the bun it was on. Our server and many inexcusable reasons why he didn't get our food to us sooner. When you first walk into this place they have flames shooting all over so where the heck was the hot food and flavor? I really hoped for a better burger at this place.	0
This review is for their Greenfield park restaurant. Went there with friends, service is quasi I existent and very very very poor. Food does not seems to be fresh. We didn't even got our appetizers, lamb was undercooked and butter chicken was super oily. This is far from being Indian food it's junk!	0
The first time I went it  was a cool cute place. I thought I found a new place for my pedi and eyebrow wax. The second time I went I again opted for the pink polish pedi ($30). Only this time my tech was a little rude and seemed to pay more attention to the dog the lady next to me had in her hand. The tech doing the ladies pedi next to me stabbed herself with the cuticle cutter and was bleeding reached over the tech table with all the tools, color, and bowl of my sugar scrub dripping her blood. Yes, the blood dripped into the sugar scrub. No one cleaned it up until the end of my pedi. So I would look down and see the blood dripping down the bowl. I was so grossed out.  I would have been okay with everything if at the very least I was treated like a valuable customer and given a proper pedi. The tech dropped the towel on my toes and did a inadequate job trying to fix it. Neglected to help me out if the chair. Can a girl get the arm rest lifted, shoes picked up and directions on where the room is to get my eye brows waxed??? No she just disappeared!! I won't even talk about what happened to my poor eyebrows. Upon later inspection of my $30 single coat pedi with half my toes covered with a top coat and a smudge on one of my left toes needless to say I will NOT be going back!!  Lets hope my eyebrows grow back so I can get a proper eyebrow waxing and as for my toes I will have my 4 year old niece paint them. She does a better a job!!	0
Yes it's a cheap place, you get what you pay for and that also includes horrible customer service.	0
I wanted to like this place.  It had a great atmosphere and a good vibe.  We went here because it had a claim that it was \""Gluten Free.\"" Something I have to look for because of my wheat allergy so I was excited.\n\nThey didn't have a special GF menu which is not a big deal to me because typically the waiter will just fill me in or make his recommendations.  This waiter didn't know much about what foods or sauces had flour.  He didn't really have any enthusiasm to find out and come back and make some recommendations. So I had to McGyver my own meal which typically means I have to eliminate the sauces. I tip very well when waiters really know the foods and can make recommendations or atleast have the eagerness to find out for me. I don't typically eat out and this was going to be a real treat for me.\n\nI ordered scallops in butter sauce and the scallops were burnt and then raw in the middle. When I sent them back, they replaced only the one I ate half of.  I asked for a dinner salad instead and they gave it to me with croutons.  He took it back and picked off the croutons as crumbles were still there. What part of \""I can't eat flour don't you understand?\""  \n\nI sent back the salad and refused to eat as I swore someone would have spit in my food by now.  And let me tell you, I'm a very passive person when it comes to any problems with my food.  So I wasn't mad or anything and I didn't give the waiter any attitude. By the way, the waiter never apologized for any inconvenience or was concerned.\n\nThere was a huge two parties going on and every staff member kept coming in and out the patio doors fussying over the parties and most people seated were ignored and were very openly upset about the service by stopping random staff members for drink refills and to check on their food.  I was with two other people who swore it tasted nice but I don't know if they were just being polite as literally \""utter chaos\"" was going on around us and we waited 45 minutes for our table when we called in advance for a reservation.\n\nI was treating my friends so I was shocked that I was given a \""$10.00 charge\"" for food that was returned!  I hadn't eaten anything sat and drank myself silly over the ice tea and left more hungry than I came in.  There was absolutely no apology anywhere or from anyone and I couldn't believe the waiter was serious about this charge. So I didn't tip him.  Probably the first time in a really really long time that I haven't tipped a waiter.  Still feeling a bit guilty over it but it was a very bad experience and it wasn't me that night it was everyone else around us too.	0
Meh is about all I can say about Cabo. I feel like it is super over-hyped... We went in for dinner on a Tuesday night around 7pm. It was pretty crowded but there was no wait. They brought over chips & salsa. The chips were warm but I didn't get the feeling that they were made fresh. They were on the thicker side. The salsa was a mix of corn and tomatoes/peppers (pico de gallo). Not spicy and not really salsa, but ok. We each ordered our own combo taco plate ($10.50) which came with two tacos and a side. I got one BBQ Mahi taco and one Tavaruva Wahoo taco with fruit as my side (seasonal). I was incredibly underwhelmed with my food. The fish in both were way overcooked and dry. The wahoo taco was way salty and the mahi was under seasoned... Another thing that annoyed me, they only have flour tortillas... Really? A fish taco place with only flour tortillas... Even worse, they weren't homemade/fresh. They had that store bought flour tortilla smell. Come on guys... Step it up.	0
Had a terrible experience at this restaurant tonight. I ordered lamb souvlaki with a small Greek salad, Mom ordered the spinach pie. We ordered two cokes. Waitress was very sweet, brings the cokes and a \""salad\"" which consisted of lettuce, two cherry tomatoes, a few small bits of cucumber and onion with parmasean cheese on top. No Greek olives, no feta cheese. I ask for some Greek olives, waitress brings me 4 olives. Twenty minutes later we get dinner. Mom's spinach pie looks like a burrito with some cheese and chopped tomato on top. I'm Greek and we couldn't figure out what it was. We taste it and it's pretty good. Waitress brings me lamb chops which I didn't order. I tell her that I ordered the lamb souvlaki and she just looks at the plate and says \""oh\"". Then says I should eat the lamb chops while I'm waiting for the souvlaki. I cut into the lamb chop and it's RAW. I mean RAW. I point this out to the waitress, she says \""oh\"". Takes it away. Another 20 minutes later I get my souvlaki. The lamb is so tough and grizzly that I can't even chew it or eat it. I tried 6 different pieces, not one of them made it down my throat, I spit them all out. I show it to the waitress and at this point I'm starving and ready to leave and get dinner somewhere else. She suggests I order something \""quick\"", some gyro meat on a plate with some rice and a side of hummus. I agree because I'm desperate. Two minutes later she brings me out the plate. It did have a lot of gyro meat on it but it was literally dripping with grease. I picked up the meat on the fork and grease literally dripped from it. I was so hungry I ate some of it anyway. The \""side\"" of hummus was in a tiny cup, about a teaspoon's worth. I kid you not. The \""rice pilaf\"" was rice that has some puree'd carrots in it. I didn't finish dinner but Mom and I decided to box it up and order a slice of cheesecake for dessert to split since I was still hungry, having barely eaten anything. We order the slice of cheesecake, waitress comes back and says they're out of it. We get the check, they were nice enough to take my dinner of the check but in looking at the check they charged.....ready for this? SIX dollars for a Coke! That Coke should have come in a gold glass. We've taken this restaurant off our list and won't be going back. I'm sorry to say that because there are very few Greek restaurants in this area and I'd like to be able to have Greek food once in awhile, but I won't go back to this place. The only \""grease\"" in this Greek restaurant is on the plate!	0
For an upscale restaurant with 4.5 stars and $20 small plates I expected great service, quaint ambience great food and friendly staff. \n\nNote to the owner: your front of house has no business being in a restaurant. Everyone we encountered from the female ma\u00eetre d who was unnecessarily rude and pompous to Our waitress who was awful and had to take our order twice because she couldn't remember?!?!\n\nI enjoyed the pork belly in banana leaves and the lamb chops.\n\nThe appetizer Japanese small shooters were unappetizing.\n\nUnfortunately the service was just so awful it was unforgivable.	0
Took my three month old Dyson DC50(under warranty) in for servicing. I was told it would take a week. After waiting that week I called & they informed me they had just determined the problem that day & was advised vacuum would be ready within seven to ten days. After having no correspondence from Vegas Vacuum for fourteen days I followed up and was advised vacuum needed additional parts which they had to obtain from Dyson. Manager stated completion of servicing would be a additional ten days. Shockley, ten days came and went without ANY contact. On day twelve I followed up and was informed part has not arrived. I inquired if any attempt was made to contact Dyson to determine when part would be received. Clearly irritated by my questioning, Manager stated he would e-mail Dyson that day. Having a 3 year old and being without a vacuum for a month(Vegas vacuum will only give you a loaner for 24 hours at a time) I decided to call Dyson directly and after updating representative with situation, I was advised by Dyson to pick up vacuum ASAP and ship it to a vacuum repair store in California(all shipping AND packing cost paid by Dyson, they even sent all the info to the ups store of my choice) Apologetically, Dyson stated the type of servicing my vacuum needed was a common process and compilation would be seven days, INCLUDING shipping time! I received my vacuum back on day six good as new shipped to my front door! Dyson you earned a customer for life!  Vegas Vacuum & Sewing you earned this review.	0

let me say  I m a big nobu fan. we visited nobu in london, dubai, LA...\nthis nobu just opened.\nwe called around 4pm to make reservation for 7;30-8;00 they told us they are booked out :-( i was so disappointed so after a while the girl on the phone found a table for 6.\nso we were a lit bit stressed but ok.when we arrived the restaurant was not busy at all. regarding it is pretty big maybe 8-10??? tables were occupied. so i felt like ok why is this restaurant booked out??????????\n\nhosts very nice & cute girls\nservice was nice, attentive & ok nothing special what i didnt like was that our server tried to convince us to take the 7 course i think tasting menue for 190$. first of all if a restaurant has so many single items why should i pick a preselected menu??? i dont get it... \n\nanyway we ordered some sushi & maki rolls. all very good. but not wowed me for that price 10-15$ i think per roll...sushi ws yummy but overpriced they charge per piece!\n\nwe ordered the trout it was excellent 28$ our fav dish for that night by far!!!!!!!\n\nwe had miso soup7$,  edamame 7$ & shrimp tempura both ok not wow  tempura lil bit soggy for my taste not crunchy enough and again way overpriced 28 $ i think i dont know any more \n\ndessert bento boxes i had this dish in every nobu but never was so disspointed. the cake was too molten not really baked well. the green tea ice cream sooooooo ridic tiny it fitted on a tiny table spoon. are u kidding me for 15$?????? the 2 blueberries ,1 rasberry just a single joke.\nwe ordered cocktails kumquat something 16$ was good\nwe finished around 8;15 with our food & guess what still not packed & overbooked so i have no clue why the girl on the phoe sold us that restaurant as soooo OMG busy on a sunday!!!! night\n\nanyway the bill for 2 was so ridic high that we will not go back. sorry but its vegas   there are so many great restaurants why should i spend $$$ here???? \n\nu should overthink it.	0
I'm going to try and not be too polarized here but this place misses the mark hard, especially for the mile-end area (that has a lot of interesting places to course from). The prices are substantially inflated on an uninspired menu. I didn't try to many of the drinks but that's because I ordered an old fashioned (with a $10 tag) and when I asked it be made with Makers brought the price of the drink to a tune of $16. \n\nIt was a terrible old fashioned. If you're going to aim for dinner dining prices don't put tv screens in the washrooms and offer $100 vouchers to go on your birthday. Super tacky. Highly recommend avoiding this place.	0
Eli Roth is known more for his obsession with torture porn than subtle scares, so I kind of knew what I was getting into. There's even a video upstairs just cycling through the kill and gore scenes from tons of horror movies.\n\nYou start out on a tour with a guide and everything, but the acting is pretty laughable and the elevator ride/drop/crash (?) is very ineffective.  Once inside the actual labyrinth (a maze has dead ends) there's a moment where you see a giant butcher standing in the fog, just staring at you. It's actually pretty intimidating, and gave me a bit of hope that maybe this would be cool after all, but after that it's all downhill.\n\nMost of the walkthrough consists of watching girls getting butchered as the actresses scream and plead for their lives. Occasionally someone will try to pop out from around a corner, but everything feels so staged and ridiculously gratuitous that there's no tension. You're basically just strolling through some random Internet user's sick fantasies, and they're honestly pretty boring.\n\nAt the end you get sprayed with water and then have to squeeze through a giant rubber anus to get out. This place gets two stars only because of the Baby Doll Lounge, which is the upstairs club exclusive to the Goretorium.\n\nI kind of feel like this is one of Las Vegas' best kept secrets, as the open view of the strip is great and there weren't too many people there, even on a Saturday evening. The music and decor was also pretty awesome, so I enjoyed my time there.\n\nBut as for the Goretorium itself, it was pretty lame, and definitely not worth the hefty price of admission. Just YouTube a montage of death scenes from Hostel and save yourself the trouble.	0
No longer go there.  Big issue over a coupon.....not worth my time. Not big on customer service.   I buy my yogurt in Chandler on the way home.	0
In general this is a petty good Walmart, as long as you don't have to deal with management. Once management gets involved everything turns to crap In the insanity of shopping for all the Thanksgiving stuff I asked a Grocery Management employee if they carried Portuguese sausage, otherwise known as Lunguicia. She had no idea what I was talking about, but if I provided her w/ a UPC code of the product she could check. \nTold her I didn't know what the UPC might be as I don't carry them around in my head or back pocket. Told her I thought she might be able to look such information up....She got a bit trite (irritated) told me I didn't need to tell her how to do here job. Told her I'd check with another grocer who could assist me. She shrugged her shoulders, waived said \""That's your choice\"", and went about her assigned task unloading frozen turkeys. Great customer service....Management has no clue how to keep a customer.	0
Highly disappointed. This was my 2nd trip here because I had such a great first experience. They changed the menu so I wasn't sure what to order but went with the california chicken sandwich. Yuck. The sandwich was VERY dry. And I'm not even a picky eater. My husband ordered a mushroom burger and was picking off mushrooms just to get to his burger. We ordered tortilla chips and never saw them until we were ready to leave. Our bartender left for about 20 minutes and we had to ask for service. All in all, the food was bland and the service was really bad. Won't go back, except for maybe the retail store. They had cool stuff.	0
This is a major disappointment.  All of the 5 star reviews have misled me again!  I was out on this side of town and decided to finally seek good Thai food in Southern Nevada.  I hate combo Thai-Chinese places (since when did the countries share a common cuisine?)  The lunch special banner outside said \""$6.95 Lunch Specials\"" but in small print \""take-out only.\""  I ordered the spicy eggplant with basil special off the vegetarian menu.  I started with a salad (my friend and I called it \""sad\""), then got my dish - a very very small portion of eggplant and a few bell peppers, and rice, then one rangoon got delivered even though both my friend and I should have received one - and then they gave me pork wontons with my veggie meal...uh yuk!  The dish had ZERO spice in it.  I would think \""spicy eggplant\"" would indicate something, but there was not a drop of heat - no red pepper flake, chili pepper, or chili oil.  It was not worth sending back because the portion was so small, by the time I tasted a piece of eggplant to test the flavor, there was hardly any left!\nSave your money and for a really good deal, go to Galanga.  I haven't reviewed it yet because I only went once, but you get tons of food for your money there.  I would not return.	0
Moving here from California, I though that this place will not be as crowded or horrible.... WRONG !\n\nIn fact I waited for 4 hours before getting to the desk. This should not happen in a civilized 1st world country. In fact I've been to 3rd world countries and the wait in govt. agencies isn't as bad. Can I say: privatize the DMV please?\n\nOnce there I was met with a mean, mid aged Asian lady who didn't even bother making an eye contact with me. She told me that I should take a driving test although I was still licensed in CA. She charged me $25 for the test.\n\nI went online to review the Nevada DMV rules and it clearly stated that I didn't need to take the test. So I went back the next day with the rules printed to another mean, mid aged Asian lady who told me that I still had to take the test anyway.I almost lost my temper (don't do that because these weak sub-human beings will call security on you) and asked to talk to her supervisor.\n\nLong story short, the supervisor agreed that i didn't have to take the test and I should be refunded $25. Here is the problem, it takes 30 DAYS for me to receive the refund!	0
So disappointing. Sochu is located in a shopping strip with plenty of parking. We decided to stop in for happy hour. The restaurant is trying a little too hard in terms of decor - white walls, windows blocked with red and black curtains, purple lights, white tables and chairs. It's nice, but a little over the top for my taste.\n\nAfter sitting in the restaurant area, we were told happy hour (3-6 pm daily, and reverse from 10:30 to midnight) is only available in the bar. No biggie, we move. After asking for a couple beers and wine that they were out of, we had a couple reasonably priced drinks.\n\nThe food was lackluster. I did not enjoy the chicken lollipops - sauce was too thick and had little flavor. Orange puffs were pretty good, a little spicy with plenty of orange flavor, but simple. I did like the Sochu tofu - thought the tofu was fried well and dipping sauces were nice.\n\nAfter waiting awhile to catch the eye of the bartender, we ordered a couple more drinks and two more tapas. We received the drinks quickly, but after waiting 20 minutes and watching other tables who ordered after us receive their food, we figured we weren't getting more tapas. We flagged down the bartender, paid and left.\n\nNice concept, but it just wasn't for me.	0
I'm not trying to be a jerk. I'm just a bit confused why this place is closed on a holiday weekend on Forth of July at Midnight. I think	0
Typical fastfood quality. Now I remember why I don't go here. Chicken in the chicken sandwich was falling off in between the bread. Lettuce was all over the bag. Save your money, head down Pecos and checkout Parsley's for a good, quality lunch.	0
Why do vegetarian restaurants think we need \""fake\"" meat, this I do not understand.  I had a primavera sandwich which was just ok, but the patty on the roll was just as perplexing as the \""mystery meat\"" you get in your elementary school cafeteria. My sandwich came with a boring pasta salad and some tortilla chips out of a bag.  Otherwise the atmosphere was fun, and the wifi was free if you ask for the password.	0
Jason price.. Was the most discussing individual I have ever met.. Won over 5k and was asked to leave.. Super winner great hire.. Hid his name tag wouldn't tell us his name.. Asked for his manager and basically told us to get the fuck out.. Then his manager.. (Who gave us a fake card) didn't help much. Super casino guys..	0
We had seafood gumbo and salads tonight before a movie.  The food was just average.  But we were charged several dollars more for our salads than listed on the menu.  When we questioned this, the waitress did not apologize, but told us she charged us for \""dinner salads.\""  There is no mention on their menu of such a category, or any difference in salad prices between dinner or side salads.  The bill was \""adjusted\"" to the price on the menu, but there was no apology.  Do they do this deliberately to see if they can slip it by?  Be careful if you decide to eat here. We won't again.	0
Thats not BBQ...its meat with BBQ sauce :(((	0
Used to be a good spot about 2 years ago but quality is very hit or miss now. Sometimes I get amazing pupusas, but more often than not I get completely dry, empty pancakes. Their horchata isn't as great anymore either. \n\nAlso, twice in a row I've caught them inflating my tab (charged double tax first time and second time my check was somehow $5 more) and withholding my receipt, so be very careful when paying and make sure you get a receipt. I think from now on I'll drive a little more to not get ripped off.	0
Blech. Worst. French. Fries. Ever.\n\nFrozen, oversalted, pathetic potatoes who surely aspired to a better end than being served up here. \n\nHummos? How can such a delightful thing lack so much flavor?\n\nThe whole place tastes like cheap ingredients.\n\nIf you want Mediterranean food, there are far better choices in Vegas. Their old (still current??) location wasn't bad, though it seemed overpriced.\n\nTry Amena if you want similarly styled food with extra helpings of tasty!	0
The food was very average, the customer service poor, and the employees quite unprofessional. \nMy garlic bread was literally toast. No garlic at all. I had to ask her to bring me the box of garlic powder from the kitchen to season it myself. The spaghetti itself was a bit bland, but was still okay. \n\nMy waitress didn't come up to me when asking me questions. She stayed behind a counter 90% of the time and just spoke loudly to have me hear. On top of which, when I asked her for a glass of water, she slammed it on my table, and spilled part of it onto the table itself. She barely glanced back and walked away, as if she hadn't noticed. \n\nAt the end, I asked to speak to the manager, and a woman in her pajamas came out to talk to me. She was, in all honesty and truth, wearing a tank top, pink penguin sweat pants, slippers, and her bra straps were easily noticed. It seemed as if she had just woken from a nap in her office. When I explained what happened, she: sighed, face-palmed, and began to lecture me about how the waitresses can't focus on any single customer when the place is full, and gave a lazy apology before walking back to her office. \n\nI left thoroughly disappointed and angry, and never plan to return.	0
I visited this store earlier in the week and bought roast beef from the deli section.  I noticed a plastic container with cheese samples.  As I reached to turn the dome and retrieve a piece, I noticed mildew around the edges of the dome.\n\nWhen I returned home, I was going to make a sandwich.  The roast beef had an odd taste and upset my stomach.  I returned it to the store and told the manager the roast beef was bad and made me sick.  He informed me that he could not understand that, that it takes 36-72 hours for a person to get sick.  He said he had taken a food management course and learned it takes that long to get sick.\n\nI asked if he was the manager of that store, and he said no, that he is the director.	0
The worst hooters I ever ate. Wings were over-cooked, I was sick the next day from what I ate.. Just was not GOOD, the place is dirty and smells of rotten, moldy smoke.\n\nHowever, our waitress was superb, that's the reason for 2-stars.\n\nThe hooters at Sunset Station and the others around the valley are much more appetizing.	0
Every time I've been here the food has been great. That said tonight I experienced terrible service and want to make sure people watch for it. Our server was fine but her manager Lam (or Lamb?) was a nasty person. I heard him speak so negative to our server using profanity for something that was his fault. A customer should never hear that nor should an employee be crying because of bad management. I hope the establishment takes note because we go there often in large groups but it's not worth someone suffering  over. I hope this guy gets what he deserves. As a business owner I can say he would have been let go a long time ago for his attitude and bad work ethic.	0
Use to be good.  This time broke the mirror (I took pictures).  3 weeks still no word from them on repairs.  Today went in with husband, and found PJ, the owner, refuses to fix.  Thank goodness I took pictures for proof..	0
Mac and Cheese with bacon tasted like nothing but onions.  The shrimp cocktail had freezer burned shrimp.  Indifferent service.  Server didn't even know we'd sent the shrimp cocktail back.  \n\nA poor dining experience.	0
Great food, but maybe they didn't have enough staff to accommodate the amount of guests.	0
What a dump. Sitting on the patio with a large group. We came late and 20 minutes no waitress. Couldn't get the order straight, just garbage service and mediocre bar food coupled with Luke warm beer. Manager finally got involved and it kinda got sorted out. Now I remember why I don't come here but it was a ping away party. Never again	0
Was not at all impressed with this hotel.\n\nWhile the lobby is renovated, the rooms are extremely dated. The wifi was completely worthless - when I could actually connect I wasn't able to actually get on the internet. The staff wasn't overly polite. My favorite moment came on Monday morning when there was a bus making it near impossible for a about 6 cars to get out of the parking lot, including my own. When I asked a member of the staff how long the bus would be sitting there, the answer I received was a plain, \""Maybe about 10 minutes.\"" I guess anyone who has to go to work is just out of luck.\n\nThe only reason the place is getting the second star is because of the location - it's a couple quick blocks from Old Town. Outside of that, I'd suggest staying anywhere else.	0
Food was pretty good, obviously better than your normal Panda Express meal. Portions were nice and family-sized and the place was packed like always. Overpriced in my opinion just like Pei Wei which is why I don't go. I would much rather go to Abacus Inn and get more for my money. \n\nWhy 2 stars? I went with a group of 12 for a birthday celebration. We told the waiter that we would like to pay separate. She told us that was not possible because of the 18% gratuity and there was no such option on the cash register. o.0 \""Eh?\""\n\nWe all looked at each other for a minute in silence and told her that it's been done before and we would just split the 18% on all bills. For some reason, she comes back with our whole table's receipt, gives us one pen, and then tells us that we would need to divide it up ourselves and then leave the correct amount for her to pick up not forgetting to include the 18% per person plus tax. \""Use the back empty side of the receipt for scratch paper,\"" she said.\n\nThis became a 30 minute ordeal as half of us scrambled to get our phone calculators out while the other half tried to get in touch with a manager who for some reason did not exist and it was the hostess who came to apologize and then just promptly left to go back to her position. What was supposed to be a birthday celebration became a sudden blast from Pre-Algebra past. \n\nPure laziness or stupidity? Either way, a major Facepalm moment on their part.	0
This place is terrible. I had an eye infection and the health center at ASU sent me here. I wish they hadn't. The secretary is rude and so are most of the patients. You never actually get seen at your appointment time. I waited as much as an hour. They take people in whatever order they damn well please. They skipped me for some obnoxious woman who had a later appointment. Now that my eye is better, I will not be returning and I recommend that no one else does either. Unless you want to pay a heinous amount of money to get treated terribly.	0
I had a similar experience as to Jason B.\n\nPalms Place is the biggest piece of shit place on the strip and that says a lot considering how many places their are on the strip.\n\nMy friends and I paid for a 2,000 sqft suite and we arrive to see that our balcony doors open, our bathroom doesn't lock, and that one of the lights doesn't work. We call to have the bathroom fixed and no one comes by.\n\nThe next day they accidentally checked us out by mistake despite it saying that we were there for two nights instead of one and wouldn't let us back in to our rooms until we got a hold of the person who's name it was under. Because they made a mistake, we had to pay for it. They also wouldn't clean our room and on Sunday, they told us they would send someone by to clean it and the person never came.\n\nThere was other things like this that happened but overall it's a real shitty place to stay, off the strip, has lousy management, and you don't get what you pay for.	0
Everything about this joint was just ok. There is a very limited menu consisting of appetizers, and a variety of both sandwiches and brautwurts (that's it). I tired the wurst sampler and each of the sausages were rather bland, only one had some real flavor. The beer is what this place is supposed to be about but I found both beers I had to not be very good. \nI came in OMB looking for a burger a beer and to watch the game, with only one TV I only got one of those things. \nDef wouldn't run back there for anything.	0
WARNING do not go here!!!! I bought $150.00 dollars of plants here about 2 weeks ago and one of the plants had a pod on it that I didn't see and it opened and now the plant is infested with bugs. I put this plant and some pansies i bought there in my atrium where I have no other plants and now I have bugs everywhere. \nWhen I called the nursery and told them what happened they said oh well! All the other nurseries guarantee their plants this place sells you diseased plants on purpose knowing you will be stuck with them. I used to go there all the time, I will never go back!!!!! Beware!!!!!	0
I was walking around aimlessly for 15 minutes, hoping I could get some assistance. That was wishful thinking. The staff seems to be in their own world. The Geek Squad people are even worse. There is a line of people waiting and the only employee not doing something is texting at her register. Girl I get it.. Work is boring but can you please help me right quick?\n\nNote to Management: Arrange some customer training for your employees. I'm thinking they need a refresher course on how to deal with us. This is not a lost cause. There is definitely room for improvement.	0
My husband and I went to Chin Chin on Friday night May 16 2014. I explained to the waitress I have an egg allergy and couldn't have any mayo or mayo based sauces. She seemed to understand. When she brought our sushi I thought the inside of the roll was cream cheese. I didn't think to ask. The first and only bite I took I realized it had mayo inside. We sat there for a long time waiting for the waitress to come back so I could ask her about the mayo. Her response was, \""well there's only a little mayo to bind the crab inside.\"" Too bad I don't have a little allergy. The manager came over to apologize but didn't even offer to take care of the bill. I had to find a place that sold Benadryl to counter act the allergic reaction. I have been sick since then. If you need or want your food made a certain way don't go to Chin Chin. I am incredibly disappointed in the experience we had.	0
Swung by here for lunch with friends and we were all pretty disappointed in the food we got. I guess it was decent food, but the main trend we noticed was that everything was super salty. My girlfriend ordered the Shrimp Parmesan and it was literally getting a fork full of salt. We had to to-go it and I brought it back to the hotel and recooked it, diluting the dish with water and letting it simmer. It was pretty good after that, but I didn't pay to have to recook my own food. I had the California Wrap which was pretty decent, but nothing special either. My friend had the Talapia and a chunk of his fish was missing from his plate while my other friend ordered a pepperoni pizza that was just tomato sauce and a few pepperonis on a super thin crust. We were pretty unimpressed to be short..\n\nThe only silver lining this place has is that their drinks special is quite legit. This is actually where I'm giving it a few stars in this review. Two drinks for $10 in their special -- I tried the Key Lime Pie which tasted off, but then followed the drink up with their Almond Joy which was basically a disguised White Russian. Pretty good way to wash out the salt in our mouths!	0
Went today for father's it's one of my fave's spot but today my wife went to the restroom to take my daughter, she came back she had lost her appetite the restroom was disgusting.  They had just brought our food had to take to good. \nThey won't get my business no more.	0
Love this place!  It is a blessing and very reasonably priced.	1
This restaurant has consistently good food at very reasonable prices. I wouldn't bring a date here but I would definitely come here for lunch or dinner with friends. Also this restaurant is open late so a great place to sober up after drinks.	1
Food is excellent and tasty! The Roaring Tiger and Lad Na are my favorite dishes but the curries and of course Pad Thai are delicious, too. Portions are generous and the service is spectacular. Would definitely recommend!	1
Wow, another fantastic experience with this company. Tonya (Admin) and Dustin (technician)...you guys killed it! Thanks for taking such good care of me and for the honest appraisal of services needed. I simply won't use anyone but Dukes. As long as they are business, no other company in this industry is relevant to this impressed customer! Great work guys...keep it up. \nJR	1
Great service, and delicious food!\nI had the croissant with ham & cheese, which, to my surprise, came served in a full dish with salad on the side, like a regular lunch course.\n\n\n For dessert I tried their chocolatiest treat: Chocolate ganache cake. Delicious and SO chocolatey!! My boyfriend had the waffle with nutella and I have to admit I stole about half of it. delicious waffle!!!\n\n\n At the end, I went upstairs for the bathroom, and saw that the best seats are actually on the top floor! With a bird's eye view on the Royal mile, you can people watch from just about any comfy seat (it's armchairs-only upstairs!!) thanks to well-placed mirrors. Lovely!!	1
I stumbled across this place by accident. I must admit I did not have high expectations, the food in casinos is usually not that good. I was hungry and in a hurry and this place had a small line that moved quickly. I was in no particular mood that day and ordered at random. My selection was The Full Montagu, a sandwich comprised of roast beef, roast turkey, swiss & sharp cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce.  The sandwich is served hot and toasty. It was excellent! The combination of meats, cheeses, and sauce was well balanced. The sandwiches here are different and a refreshing change from Quiznos, Togos, or Subway.	1
Busy place on a saturday night but they were able to accomodate our party of 12 within about 45 minutes. While we waited we had some beers at the very large bar they have at the front. Several TVs and not dissapointed the the beer. Hop Knot and the Kiltlifter are two of my favorite brews from this place. \n\nFood: this is my second time back and think it will be my usual when im ever in Tempe. Ordered the Filet, it had great flavor and cooked perfectly, not dry at all. Had the steamed veggies, which were realy good. They dont cook them all the way so they still have a crunch to them which I enjoyed. For apps get the calamari, they are long and larger than ive typically seen. Be sure to dip them in the spicy red sauce, it makes the app!\n\nAtmosphere: this place is packed. But it doesnt necessarily make you want to turn away. The service is great and staff is friendly. Youre in an older red brick warehouse style brewhouse, its a little noisy but as to be exoected for a restaurant this large. Really great atmosphere in my opinion,  unless youre looking for a quiet date night. TVs are in all directions so its a good place to watch the game as well. \n\nOverall 4 out 5 stars...its a solid choice in all aspects, but may not blow your mind. Ill definitely be back though!	1
A reliable, trustworthy cleaner for your dry clean onlys that won't rip you off is hard to come by.  Green's owner, however, really gives you that sense that she cares about your clothes--she gave me tips, for instance, on how to keep crickets and moths at bay from my winter cashmere.  Best of all, she will give customers, new and old, a 20% discount with or without the coupon.  Try Green Cleaners out!	1
I like the ambiance of this place...it's pretty and trendy but not too loud. The food and service are really good. THE BEST DESSERT is the Bars of Sin. It is worth going to the restaurant, if just to eat that! PROMISE.	1
We ordered sole, shrimp,  mac n cheese and fries. Ooo home made lemonade!  Everything was hot and fresh!  Really nice mom and pop shop... ran by a Dad and Son.  So sweet!  The food reminds me of the Louisiana style you buy we fry in California.	1
I think my real rating would be more like a 3.5, but since I can't do that, I'll err toward the better side.\n\nOur server, lemme say, was GREAT - funny, nice, very available, very helpful in menu recommendations/wine selection/reminding us of upcoming specials, etc. I'm pretty sure his name was Travis, but I won't make any promises.  Anyway - he was very friendly & definitely a pro.\n\nThe menu was extensive - there would definitely be something for even the pickiest of eaters.  I'm not a tapas expert, my boyfriend wouldn't call himself an \""expert\"" but he knows a lot more than me, and he seemed to think the menu was great, too.\n\nI'm not big on seafood (with the exception being, of course, fish fry - I AM from Wisconsin after all! :D), so we had the short ribs that our server recommended, the chicken croquettes, the goat cheese, the artichoke & fennel salad, and then we had the chorizo flatbread.  I couldn't resist dessert, I ordered the pear tart & the truffle cake.\n\nMOST of the food we got was excellent, the only complaints I have are 1) in regards to the desserts.  The ice cream on one tasted freezer burned to me, which was a total buzzkill, and the other one, the tart seemed kind of frozen, ((but the cake & the tart were soooo good that it ALMOST made up for it.)) and 2) the portions were super small for what they were charging.  We've eaten tapas in Boston & paid less for bigger portions, which is surprising, because Boston's usually a pretty expensive city.  BUT the food was great :D\n\nThey also have $15 bottles of wine on Wednesday nights, which we were happy to take advantage of :D.  We decided later that it's a pretty good gimmick - cuz for the two of us we spent over $70 on dinner, way more than we usually would have for a non-special occasion - so if you can get people in by lowering the wine price, so be it!  We left happy.\n\nThe decor in there is spectacular, although there's not a lot of space.  I was kind of disappointed that on a Wednesday night we had a table seated right next to us and we were elbow to elbow and practically sharing conversations with one another the whole time.  But it's not like there was anywhere else to put them, the place was relatively full for a Wednesday.  Space on State St. is at a premium, so I'm not surprised that the place is pretty small, and you've gotta serve as many people as possible in order to pay that rent, so I don't begrudge them that.  \n\nThe moral of the story is, I'd definitely go back for drinks, dessert, appetizers, but I don't know if I'd go back for dinner, just because of the cost/portion size thing.	1
I just had lunch with the girlfriends At TB and was pleasantly surprised.  We had a party of 16 chatty women and our server-Derek- treated us like royalty!  He gave descriptive menu recommendations that were spot on.  He managed to keep all of our orders straight, with a number of special requests, and his pacing was spot on. You always worry that service will be sub par with a big group-but Derek never missed a beat.  To top it off I ordered his suggestion, the Chicken Mango Salad-and it was the perfect meal for a hot summer day.  It had sweet, sour, crunchy, yumminess in every savory bite!  I will certainly look forward to my next visit!	1
best service any music lover could ever ask for! i bought my first guitar from this location a while back and i recently just stopped in to buy my first pedal for my guitar. i have to say that Zachary (i believe thats his name.. slightly ginger hair, short scruffy beard) helped me out so much! he spent over an hour and a half with me showing me/ letting me play just about every pedal they had out. he not only took the time to teach me how the pedal worked and what certain settings do and what sounds they make (as I've never used a pedal before in my life) but he also really took an interest as to what sounds i am into as far as playing goes and was also showing me cool sounds with different combinations of pedals that he thought would work well with my sound. he didn't try and push me toward any certain pedal just to get me out of there, he helped me to experiment with each sound to let the right pedal find me. his expertise helped me narrow down the selection and ultimately pick the perfect pedal. i walked out of there feeling extremely confident and happy with the choice of pedal, i was super anxious to get home and start experimenting!!! i from now on will ALWAYS be buying any future pedals/guitars from this guitar center, they know what they are doing. thanks so much zachary!!	1
Fantastic vet!	1
The Faubourg is in a constant flux of renovation but no matter how difficult it is to find the staircase or escaltor amid the construction, Bangkok, nestled on an unassuming third floor food court, always has a crowd. Now many people love marveling that \""the best Thai food in Montreal is located in a food court.\"" They're wrong. Bangkok is not the best Thai in Montreal but it is by far the best Thai for the price in Montreal. Most dishes are between 6 and 7 dollars (compare to 15-18 at the better and fancier Thai places). So it's good food for the same prices you'd pay for a pile of greasy noodles at Thai Express (although I admit to eating there once in a while but that's just because they're practically everywhere)\n\nThe food is spicy too. Usually when I ask for spicy, it's not. I once saw a woman trying to return a green curry chicken because she said it was \""too spicy.\"" After they tried to explain to her that curry is spicy, she left her hardly touched plate on the table and walked off in a huff.  I laughed and thought to myself (although wished I had the gall to ask her to her face), \""you ordered a curry. What did you expect? If you don't like spicy food, why are you eating Thai at all?\""	1
It's rare that you find a place that is exactly what you've been looking for in a conversation spot, a pre-drink, a hang-out and \""let's go there\"" without experiencing a parking problem and obnoxious patrons.\nAs I have experienced it, the Pigs Meow appears to be one of the Phoenix/Arcadia concepts that has scored dramatically and is drawing a lot of attention in only two months. You'll love this place. I love it so much I'm holding off my review so I can enjoy the synergistic and soulfully crafted environment for now...	1
We had a restaurant coupon and thought we would use it. I had been there once before but only for a quick cheese pizza. \n\nThe hostess explained they no longer accept the coupons because they were not getting a fair deal. They have no way of adding the 18% gratuity to the order and were finding folks were leaving nothing. She explained that we can get a credit from R.com for the cert. Cool I can't say I blame them. \n\nShe offered some suggestions and they did not disappoint. We had the Tuscan pizza and the Mediterranean salad. I suggest getting garlic on the pizza, once we added a little it made it that much better. \n\nI would go back. The bar was well stocked and the menu was varied enough to keep me there a few more times.	1
Such a convenient location if you are staying at Cosmo, Aria or Paris. Quick satisfaction. Earl never disappoint me :)	1
Dr. Wendy is absolutely the best! When you see her you have no doubt that the only thing that she wants is for you to be in optimal health, there is no question in your mind of anything else. I've known Dr. Wendy for many years and have always found her to be compassionate, thorough and utterly focused on health. I have recommended her countless times and will continue to do so.	1
All the salads and soups are excellent, I drive across town for this one.  The little sweet lady that owns and cooks here is a doll.	1
I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here.  The layers of flavors in my Al Pastor, Tinga and Carne Asado Tacos were awesome!  My only complaint was I was expecting it to be less expensive based on the single $ on yelp.  I think this should be updated to $$.  (I didn't mind paying what I did at all, it was totally worth it, but the expectation based on what I had read here was in my head.)	1
It's been a while since my last visit, but they did have everything I needed. I was taking a color theory/composition class which required specify taklon brushes and certain shades of acrylic paint. They had it all, even the paper I was looking for. Yep their pricey, but you get what you pay for, and they are a specialty store. Can't wait to revisit.	1
Post med school interview. Perfect. All the beer was wonderful and the service was great.	1
First time at Texas De Brazil in Vegas.  Having been to one in Dallas previously, I knew what to expect.\n\nI went with several people in my industry after a trade show.\n\nThe salad bar was just what I needed.  Being a sucker for Spinach, I was able to concoct a spinach salad with all the decadent goodies I wanted, while not spoiling my appetite for the meatfest to follow.  Fresh mozzarella balls, balsalmic, ripe tomato slices...perfect.\n\nThe meats were broiled to perfection, speedily brought around to the tables, and rarely did I see the same cuts, unless I had seen the rest of the variety  first.  The lamb chops and leg were my favorite.	1
I was on my way to pick up my wife at PHX airport.  On the way up, I was famished, so I pulled off to have some dinner.  Rudy's was closer to the exit, so I ate there and had the most rubbery ribs I can recall eating ever.  Yuk,\n\nOn the way back to Tucson, I brought my wife to Can't Stop Smokin.  She had the same kind of ribs that I had at Rudy's.  We ordered a large amount so I could try them also.  Can't Stop Smokin's ribs were smoky and tender and delicious.  The sides were pretty good too.\n\nNot the best ribs I've ever had (like Coulter's or Dickey's in Dallas) but pretty darned good. \n\nNext time I'm in the area, I'll stop here for food.	1
I took my sister out for dinner here. This place is awesome! We had Teriyaki wings and deep dish chicken Alfredo pizza soo delicious!! Loved the beer sampler as well! When I come back to Vegas def coming back!	1
I personally like the Strawberry Flavor but the Octane is the strongest! \n\nMy Recommendation, Go to Fat Tuesday (At ANY location) hope its hot outside and let the Liquor hit your system... lol You'll be drunk in 10 mins.. \n\nKeep the refill cup and use the $1 off coupon for your trip	1
If you're looking for a new watch then where better to get it than from a place with the same name? With the fresh white exterior and the funky signage Watch is a very inviting little shop indeed and looks funky from both inside and out. \n\nThey stock stacks of watches here all from good quality makes including; DKNY, Roxy, Alessi, Guess, Diesel and my favourite Rotary to name but a few.\n\nIf it's time you got a new watch head in here!	1
Best pizza great italian food love \n\n maria and gasper are the best hosts	1
This place just opened in March so they're still offering their $5.99 eyebrow wax and $19.99 (normally $35) Deluxe Spa Pedicure deal, which includes a leg mask, sugar scrub, seaweed gel, moisturizing lotion, hot stone massage, callus scrub, and hot towels in addition to the typical cleaning and polish. It's owned by either a Vietnamese or Cantonese speaking family (I'm actually not sure, but that's what my best guess would be. I like guessing what language people are speaking =] It's a silly game I play with myself). They have 6 pedicure chairs and 6 manicure stations, all brand new stuff, very clean and bright salon. I like when my toe nail cleaning is on the gentler side, and Vivian did just that perfectly!! I've had rougher experiences in the past at other salons and that will definitely make me give a smaller tip, but I like a softer touch. I'm definitely going back to this place in a few weeks! \n\nThe ONLY reason I gave 4 stars is because I'm quite stingy with 5 stars. I've never had a superwowthisblewmeoutofthewater kind of pedicure, so I'll save that last star for when that actually happens...probably on my wedding day or something =]	1
Ill keep this review short and sweet, this was thee best meal my husband and I have ever had. We both agreed. Id come here once a week if I could. The best thing on menu? Everything. If i had to choose one.. the short ribs.	1
Glad we decided to try this tonight. Nice unpretentious neighborhood atmosphere and good service. We had the crab dip, which is quite good, and served with a large portion of homemade potato chips. We ordered the burger with bleu cheese and the patty melt, both of which were solid. We had salads on the side rather than fries because of the big appetizer so I'm looking forward to trying the regular or sweet potato fries on future visits, as well as the different entrees. We ended by sharing a nice coffee creme brulee. Only minor complaint is that I'd like a larger draft beer selection but I can live without that.	1
Came here based on the reviews and everyone was on point. I ordered the po-boy and curry fries. The shrimp had a lot of flavor and the bread was nice and soft. The fries had just enough curry that it didn't make the fries soggy. My cousin had the pho dip which was the bomb and the chowder hit the spot on this cold day.	1
I was very surprised how good the food is here. I had a chicken burrito and for the price and quality I really enjoyed it.  The chips and salsa are amazing two different salsas. Happy hour is amazing the only downfall is the atmosphere they had a bootleg UFC fight on every tv. Like the fights you see on a weird channel, Just kinda weird for a Mexican joint. I hope this place stays around I didn't see too many people in here.	1
I would give it 4.5 if I could. Queso con puerco was really good! Better than I expected. The manager saw that we wanted happy hour and got us sat just outside the bar but let us still get happy hour; amazing service! The pork was amazing! Got it to go and it was still good! Our server Matthew was great I will request him next time I am in.	1
Everytime I go to Vegas, \n\nI come watch this, it's romantic,it's mesmerizing, it's beauty in motion laced with the grace of dreams...	1
Love this place - I have been stopping by since it opened in the far NE Valley years ago. GREAT selection of wine and their fruit and cheese plate is awesome. Sitting out on the patios when the weather is nice is the best.	1
Two weeks into a three week trip out west and finally have had an outstanding meal. I literally could have ordered anything on the menu. The mushroom-pumpkin soup was really tasty (my wife gave me but one spoonful). Lentil soup was superb. Would order the pomegranate chicken again if I did not want to someday try the whole menu. \nAlas, we live in PA, just a little too far for dinner and a movie. If this place was close to home we would be there all the time. The very friendly owner came by to chat twice during our meal. This is a family owned business: she is Greek, hubby the chef is Italian. Decor is simple and immaculately kept.\nOh yes, don't leave without eating the pumpkin cheesecake.	1
This is a hidden gem. I met with Joe, the owner, and he is trying to build a niche shop, which is very exciting.  Awesome small (but growing) whiskey selection. Nice respected wine labels. Wine tastings are available at scheduled times. This place has potential, and Joe's attitude is right where it should be. \n\nI can't wait to see how this progresses. \n\n5 stars for the attitude and potential.	1
I came to this place because of the great reviews. I went on a Saturday at around 11am and had to wait 45 minutes to an hour.   If you play the penny slots nearby the wait isn't so bad. Finally we were seated and ordered the chicken and waffles and Andy's Benedict. I really loved the chicken and waffles, the Benedict was good but not as great as I would've liked. My favorite was the biscuit and the mashed potatoes but I wasn't too crazy about the sauce that was all over it (a little spicy). Presentation and portions are definitely impressive. I was happy to take huge leftovers for later in the day. Overall I think I would come back if I come to vegas with friends that haven't been here before.  Decently priced for vegas as well.	1
Yum. This place was awesome. First off... I love the selection of Macarons. I think there were like a dozen. And they melt in your mouth. My frozen Vanilla coffee drink was fantastic and didn't wire me up too much. The place is practically designed for college students in need of a great place to study. There were outlets EVERYWHERE. There's even a second level that I will explore next time. The service was fast, friendly, and helpful when I had stupid questions. I will definitely be back to sample more awesomeness.	1
Gotta love that drive-through service. Close to home and they are pretty fast in responding to your needs. Zip in and zip out, no problems. They have two lanes. Full service and a drop off only lane.	1
Rooms (Suites 32 floor) are gorgeous..  Spa a bit over priced for just a manicure but hey it's Vegas baby.  The Grand Lux Cafe has some terrific food - yum on the Carmel Fried Chicken - Whoah!!!  The restaurant Aqua Knox doesn't have as good food as I recall the prior two times but Hillary (waiter) is the best.  When he retires in April - after 19 years - well... I can't say I'll go back.  Mesa Grill is spectacular but the best restaurant by far was Delmonico's.  OMG for the price - it was unbelievably good.  Seriously, my husband and I had fried chicken..  Yeah at a steak place - buttermilk fried chicken - the bomb!!  hahahaha  Our son got the bone in Filet Mignon and it was superb (even rare).  The one individual I'd like to have you see when you get to the hotel is Danny Pascarelli at the Circle Bar in the Casino.  Danny is old school service.  He won't forget your name, what you drink or make you feel any other way than an ol friend.  Danny remembers the what bartending should be - he's classy and sophisticated.  He knows how to treat people and takes care of all the guests (multi-tasking like crazy) while making each individual feel like they are the only ones at the bar.  He facilitates introductions and gets people having fun, playing the games and really having a good time.  Nice 4 night stay and quite comparable to the Palazzo.  The Gonzales Family truly had a wonderful time and we'll be back.  One last note... Carne Vino is also a fantastic restaurant if you can drop minimum $100 per person.  It was a great experience and the food was amazing.  This was our 2nd time at Carne Vino and back to back 2 thumbs up.	1
Probably some of the best sushi in town. This place isn't really well known within the mainstream sushi spots in town, but this place is on the verge off becoming one of the most popular places. Freshest sushi and sashimi, never disappoints...The best time to come is during happy hour when the sushi is extra cheap. I highly recommend the philly roll.	1
In so many ways this place was perfect. We had a group of 5 and we all ordered appetizers and different drinks, dinners, and desserts. It way easier for me to say what we didn't like, rather than what we did, because 95% was awesome. My daughter has a type of bratwurst with cream in it that no one at the table enjoyed, but the other sausages we had, including the meat platter was incredible. I had the trout that was spectacular. The other perfect food I had was some type of pecan pie that words cannot describe how amazing it was. I must also make mention of the service, as I had emailed in advance because I have a son with autism. Although they don't take reservation, they made a note of my need and advised me to arrive as close to opening, which we did (amazingly it was already packed). We had a perfect table near the window and my son couldn't have been happier. The server was also fantastic.	1
Usual costco, but the guy in the TV department was very helpful and honest.  I just wanted to comment that he is a great guy.  They were out of stock on what I wanted but I bought at costco.com based on his helpful input. Thanks.	1
Great place, Its loud, packed, EXPENSIVE FOR what you get and only has valet. But, I like and will return. Have only been twice, but since Gaspers burnt  or closed down, this is pry my fav  for Italian in central Phoenix.	1
We ate here after walking past and thinking it look interesting.  Our waitress, Amanda, was very attentive and dealt with my food allergies.  The executive chef even came to our table to help me choose an entree.  The food was wonderful and included some of the best veggies I have eaten in a very long time.  We will eat here again any time we are in town.  The best meal we have eaten in a very long time.	1
If you are looking for fun, unique, challenging (both mentally and physically), total body workout look no further than Surfset! The entire class is based around core muscle control and getting a killer workout in while - you guessed it - balancing on a surfboard! Resistance bands are positioned on the sides of the boards so if you don't start of being a professional (ha!) you can take baby steps to get there. This concept is truly genius. \n\nThis was (and definitely would be in the future) a fun class to take as a group. It is laid out similar to a dance studio but with surfboards everywhere...however the mirrors everywhere help you to see that you are not alone in occasionally taking a nose dive off the board. ;) It's really a motivating and encouraging group atmosphere.\n\nThe instructor and owner, Jason, was very easy to work with and helpful. I would highly recommend this class!\n\nThank you Surfset and Yelp for putting on such a fun event!	1
We live right by this place and see it all the time! We finally got a chance to go in and it was really nice surprise. The owner Sabi came and took our order and was very pleasant to talk with. The food was made fresh and when they brought out eggrolls instead of the dumplings we had ordered, we told it was no big deal that we would eat the eggrolls. She ended up making us the dumplings and bringing those out for free! The cost was good, considering it's close proximity to the strip. Yay finally a cheap place for lunch!	1
Ginban has become our go-to family sushi spot in A-town...it's excellent...only thing holding this pace back is inconsistent service. \n\nThe place is modern and stylish, especially considering the strip mall location.  The sushi bar is attractive and functional. There are TVs strategically placed around the restaurant, which is perfect if you want to catch snippets of the Blackhawks playoff match out of the corner of your eye while pretending to give your family your full attention. \n\nThe food is outstanding. The salmon sashimi is fresh and delicious and the yellowtail is among the best I've tasted.  I'm not a big roll fan, but the family really likes theirs; especially the Tiger Roll and the Eel Avocado roll.  The Unagi is really good as well. I've also tried the chicken teriyaki, which was good and tastefully presented but not life-changing. \n\nThe beer selection is just fine. The usual Japanese staples plus one or two nice surprises (Dog Fish Head 60 Minute IPA, I think!). Could be served colder, but whatever. \n\nI get that handcrafted sushi can take a while, but they need to get it together.  Orders come out at odd times, like last night all three courses of my dinner were served long before the rest of the family received even their first morsel  of delicious raw fish.  There is also the occasional mistake, like the time we received ahi sashimi instead of salmon, but these things happen. One thing that would really help would be if the servers could kick up their attentiveness. They always avoid you like you've got SARS during these awkward long waits.  Invariably we want another beer or to add to our sushi order, but there is no one to be found...or even anyone willing to make eye-contact!  Of course, during a grown-up dinner with epic quantities of sake bombers they should take their sweet-damn-time bringing the fish. \n\nUltimately, we still love this place despite its flaws. The sushi is worth the wait and we have resolved to plan ahead more, but a little better service would mean a lot regardless.	1
Ok, I'm not a fan of going to the dentist.  (Is anybody?)  Once we get past that, I came in to see Dr. Khaydatov today for my regular cleaning, which is supposed to be every 6 months, but hey, once a year is enough drama, right?  Anyhow, here's how it went today:\n\nI was seen on time, & my procedure went right along...  x-rays, exam by Dr., prep for cleaning by assistant Peyton, & then cleaning actually performed by Dr. Khaydatov.\n\nI am 100% happy with the service I received here today.  Both Dr. Khaydatov & Peyton are friendly & professional, & the receptionists are nice too.  Also, the prices here are have been very reasonable, with no effort made at any time to try to oversell me services, electric toys, or anything else.\n\nIt's an easy 5 Stars for this DC Dental Group office & I absolutely recommend them!!     :-))	1
Where is this place? Its in an office complex that can be totally missed if you weren't looking for it. The decor inside and on the patio is pretty fantabuloso. We went here for my wife's bday and it was a blast. We scored the cool patio tent which made for an excellent evening outside with the Vegas heat cooling down (yet after a few glasses of wine you get heated up again) Word on the patio tent is first come first serve, or if you need it guaranteed for your dinner plans, plan to drop $1000 min to secure it. Otherwise anywhere else in the restaurant is still a nice experience. We were here on a sat night and to our surprise we got to enjoy a really cool band set up next to our tent. It was a very nice chillaxin vibe with good food and good company. \nThe food was excellent and expect to pay 25 - 30+ for entrees. The only problem I had was with the initial reservation. I had called and made the reservation on a Tuesday, for a Saturday evening dinner. Luckily I called a few hours ahead to confirm reservations because they had no record of it!!!!! If I remember correctly, the initial girl I spoke with seemed really distracted taking my reservation and answering my questions, almost sounded annoyed. I was really disappointed with this. But luckily the nice girl who I spoke with the day of our reservation assured me she could fit us in and even made sure we scored the tent when we arrived. Much thanks for that. I forgot your name but you were the pretty, sexy, black girl with short hair at the front! The whole staff that night was pretty busy but still accommodating. The food, service and overall experience was great.	1
Freaking amazing!  \n\nWay over priced... but its something that you only do once.  Unless you are crazy wealthy.  The tickets we had were about $200 a piece (because the cheaper ones were sold out) , and if you don't mind sitting in the nose bleeds you can tickets for $100.  If you can afford it... I would defiantly recommend it.  \n\nThis is the 2nd Cirque Du Soleil show I've seen... the first being Myst\u00e8re at Treasure Island.  This one was even more amazing, and if you only get to see one show... make it this one!  Don't be cheep... see this show.  It is worth it!\n\nMy only complaint... that I forgot to take a camera.	1
let's be fair, less than $6 buffet,  have streamed salmon, shrimp, like their jalapeno chicken, and tofu, nothing really stands out, but no wait, and the price is right.  some of the selections I don't see it from China Star.  the server does do a good job cleaning up and getting the bills.	1
The cafe is located on the second floor. \n\nThe staff is very friendly and attentive. \n\nThe main reason I love coming here is to order the mixed berry chicken salad. Mixed Berry Salad with Chicken has strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, candied walnuts, blue cheese & mixed greens tossed in a raspberry vinaigrette with chicken. I love it. The Nordstrom Cafe at home in Hawaii but it does not carry this salad. The vinaigrette dressing is a bit tart so I like to get it on the side since you never know if the person making the salad has a heavy hand or not. \n\nOther than that, this place has all my usual Nordstrom Cafe favs like the tomato basil soup. ^_^*~	1
We've been to the Grimaldi's in Chandler.  Great pizza there.  We had high expectations when we came to this one in Gilbert, and we were not disappointed!\n\nWe were greeted promptly when we arrived.  I suppose I could ding them for telling us it was a 15 minute wait and then seating us in 5 minutes, but that's a positive error so I'd feel odd doing it!\n\nThe server was very friendly, and even offered to serve up the first slice when the pizza came.  She did well.\n\nThe pizza was hot, fresh, and very good.  This place is a tad pricey, though if you have a coupon that can help.  A great pizza with excellent service.  No complaints.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting a great pizza.	1
Possibly the best Indian food I have had in Vegas so far. I had the Rebel Curry, which while not being spicy at all was very tasty. My friend had the Chana Masala. We also split a couple different kinds of Naan. I thought the dining area was nice, the lights were dim and the tables were spread out enough that it was pretty quiet in there. We also tried a few different deserts and they were very good. The menu was huge so I will definitely be coming to try some more dishes.	1
Wanna get plastered off sweet and girly margaritas by the yard? Check.\n\nWanna be one of those people walking down the strip with their obnoxiously long bottles? Check.\n\nWant extra shots of 151 for $1 each? Check.\n\nWant cheap refills so you can do it all over again? Check.\n\nYou get the idea. There's never any regrets with Fat Tuesdays... hangovers and brain freeze included for free. There are several locations on the Strip but this one inside Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile is the one I frequent the most. Also located inside MGM Grand, Caesar's Forum Shops, Imperial Palace, Mandalay and Stratosphere. Happy drinking!	1
I ate here my first night in Pittsburgh and thought that the Oakland area was so much cooler than it actually was because of it. The food isn't mind-blowing Indian food, but it is pretty damn good - and if you go during Late Night it's well worth the price. Like others have mentioned I love that it is open late, very reassuring in a college town, and the ambience is just fantastic. This is one of the few over-decorated restaurants I don't feel is contrived (i.e. buca di beppo) - the abundance of decor seems authentic and who can get enough of the bollywood videos playing in the background? It makes the wait for the food just fly by. Food is okay but extra points for the experience as a whole.	1
Two words: chocolate fountain. Two more words: TORTILLA CHIPS. Let me elaborate. FLOUR tortilla chips. They're incredible. Like, can't stop eating them incredible. They're like little triangles of heaven melting on your tongue. Salsa, guac, hot sauce, it's doesn't matter! I eat them plain! By the handful! I actually dipped the tortilla chips IN the chocolate fountain.\n\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself. The decor at Aunt Chilada's is rainbow cactus chic. Not a dull table or view from anywhere in the restaurant. The service is top notch. You can tell a lot of people have been working here a while which makes me believe they treat the staff well. The plates of food are large, complete with refried beans, pico de gallo, lettuce and cheese. All of which you can scoop up with the TORTILLA CHIPS FROM GOD.\n\nBut really, the food here is incredible. The chocolate fountain is on Sundays for brunch. And the tortilla chips are all the damn time. It seems a bit off the beaten path, but well worth the drive. It is a must-go every time I'm in the area. Go forth and salivate.	1
This is one of the best sushi restaurants I have been to anywhere. They have a wild collection of specialty rolls with some of the filthiest names on earth. The Spicy Ponzu is liquid heroin. drink the leftovers, you will never be the same! Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!	1
When I walked it in I was greeted the people seemed really nice and helpful any question I had they answered it they had a variety of hair wigs and other things.\n\nI didn't see where the rudeness came in but I didn't feel like they where rude honestly I'm from from the Bay Area and the beauty supplies out there are always busy so the gift they even had time to help me was enough for me\n\nThey should try to get more longer lengths in their small hair bundle pieces because sometimes people don't want to buy a whole pack of hair but just want to add a little color to the their head !!	1
Quick service, decent and predictable food. Coffee is only so-so for me - prefer Dunkin Donuts coffee! But Einstein's Santa Fe on a green chile bagel keeps me coming back!	1
