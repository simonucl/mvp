Wanted to give there cupcakes a try.  I have to admit they are not my favorite. The cake was very crumbly and had only a slight amount of flavor.  The cream cheese frosting was gooey and messy.  I really don't feel they are worth $3.00 a pop.  Just my opinion.	0
The food here stinks! I will never go back again! Don't waste your time and money there are other restaurants with better quality food!	0
I enjoy the chicken at El Pollo Loco. I do not enjoy the wait for the chicken at El Pollo Loco and I was admittedly indifferent to the hair that I found on my chicken at my most recent visit at El Pollo Loco. I had waited for ~ 15 minutes for 3 chicken breasts and a wing (no sides, no drink) so I decided to pull the hair off my chicken, remove the portion of skin that the hair was sitting on and have at it. I will say it was still delicious albeit less than sanitary.	0
Very average - my pasta was cold,the steaks were ok but very small but the service was what really let it down.the waiter was exasperated by simple questions and when one of our party didn't get a bread roll (as they had no side plate) and requested one it was unceremoniously dumped on the table,minus a plate.i won't be back.	0
Let me start by stating I really enjoy the food here. I have been here for lunch, ordered out, and sat down for dinner and never had an issue with the food. I prefer their pizza over most places.  However, SERVICE MEANS A LOT. \n\nI have had terrible service there once in person to the point where my boyfriend wanted to walk out. Well last night I called in on my way out of work from a 12 hour shift.  I did not have much brain power left and wanted to just grab food and go home. Lets just say my phone call was very unpleasant.  I asked for pizza and ranch where the person on the phone proceeded to ask how much ranch I would like \""2 pints, half a pint, blah blah blah.\"" At this point in the day I do not have much left in my brain and was not thinking measurements I just wanted ranch. I said a cup would be fine where he proceeded to tell me \""well I do not know what that means\"" and continued to repeat himself over \""2 pints, half a pint blah blah blah\"" \n\nI then decided I would let him know I was displeased with his phone etiquette seeing he repeated himself three times when I just wanted a small container of ranch. He could have simply said \""I will show you sizes when you pick up\"" or something rather than repeating himself over when I obviously didn't understand.  When I approached him in the store he was nothing short of rude. He denied being rude and the manager stood and listened to my conversation and did not care to interject and say I am sorry for your unpleasant phone call. I paid and went to walk out and got the ever popular \""have a good night!\"" \n\nI believe I work very hard and I am pleasant to every person I come in contact with. These people are rude and unpleasant. Will never go here again.	0
Came to the Aria pool for my Birthday with my mommy friends and ate here since it was poolside. Big mistake.\nI dont know why I ordered sushi but I did and I had to send it back. It did not look good at all.\nEnded up with a chicken quesadilla..for $15 bucks.\nIt was ok..not great.\nThe overpriced drink I had was the highlight of the meal.\nI wont be eating here again.	0
Pros: Fun if you are drunk out of your mind. Or just turned 21. Or just turned 21 and drunk out of your mind. Oh, and if you are from Nebraska. Honestly though, the environment is really energetic and loud so don't expect to actually talk to anyone you are eating with. The fish and chips are good, food wise. Oh, and you can take goofy pictures, so that's fun.\n\nHint: if you walk in somewhere and they ask if you are there to drink or to eat, never eat the food. Unless you love globs and globs of cheese. The rubbery, oily kind. \n\nCons: Literally the WORST meal that I have ever paid for. Had to pay for chips and salsa. The salsa was awful. How do you mess up salsa in a Mexican restaurant? My partner ordered tacos. Only ate two bites of one taco because they were gross. Again, how do you mess up tacos in a Mexican restaurant?  \n\nI'm not too surprised because I should have known better. I mean, it's Vegas and I got a coupon for a free appetizer. There had to be a catch. Stick to the buffets, people. Your wallets and stomach will thank you.	0
First club I'd ever gone to in Vegas & I had a horrible experience. We thought we got a good deal to go in but ended up paying less at Marquee the next day & had a way better time. \n\nThis club is small & overcrowded. There is hardly anywhere to stand without being uncomfortable. The bartender completely ignored me, the free drink the club offered was weak, the security guards have huge chips on their shoulders, the dance floor is small & overcrowded. When I finally made it down there I was told by two security guards to not block the way down. Well where was I gonna go genius? I kept talking crap back to them until I had enough of this crappy club & left. They really need new employees. \nThe only plus is the good music played.	0
i went tonight and it was not crowded at all except they put my family and I with 3 drunk guys who where loud and annoying. the pod has 8 screens (4 on each side) playing the same video which is a bit too much. also, the music and videos were way too loud for such a small place. the view was only good when you got to the top, the rest of it is parking lots and roofs of buildings, which really disappointed us :( also, every single employee that we ran into had an attitude! overall, the pods are clean and air conditioned which was the only good part. this was a one time thing and i wouldn't do it again, plus it's waaaay too overpriced :(	0
My friend and I came here on December 21st for dinner after it was recommended to us by the Tix4tonight because it was close to our show's location.  We thought... meh why not? \n\nThe ambiance of the place was pretty good and the waitstaff there were very hospitable - the only aspects that prevents it from getting one star. Other than that, I would definitely not go back.\n\nThe food, first of all, was HORRIBLE.  For the price of almost $30, I've never been to a buffet more terrible than this one.  Basically, it's an International Buffet with foods: Chinese, Japanese, Latin, Italian, BBQ/roasted meats, seafoods... and of course all-you-can-drink beer, wine and non-alcoholic stuff.  The crab legs were tasteless, sushi rolls were unimpressive (rice was too hard), their Chinese food consisted mostly of North Americanized creations.  At the Italian stations, their food was lukewarm.   I've walked around the buffet many many circles to find things I'd like to eat but unfortunately didn't have too many things on my plate.  Besides the dessert station which was okay, their food selection, variety and quality was inadequate.  When tasting the food, it just doesn't taste fresh and we were both really really disappointed.	0
No bueno! I ordered a blended caramel and my husband ordered a vanilla latte. My drink taste like ice and his seriously taste like a cigarette. No joke!	0
Joel Robuchon is the \""chef of the century\"".  This place has three michelin stars, 4.5 stars on yelp, and recommended by foodies.  So naturally, after dining at a handful of michelin restaurants, we had high expectations for Joel Robuchon.  For chris sakes, Rod Stewart was sitting at the table behind us!!!  Furthermore, Joel Robuchon was in Vegas that night, and seeing him added a little extra touch.  \n\nAfter doing extensive research, my boyfriend and I opted for the two courses.  Here's our story:\n\nThe Pros:\n- Bread cart was AMAZING!!!\n- Dessert cart was awesome!\n- Amuse-bouche was yummy caviar\n- The limo ride was very much appreciated\n\nThe Cons:\nThe Food.  Aside from the above, everything was disappointing.  \n\n- Le Canard: duck was passing at best.  The foie gras on the side was overcooked. We love foie gras, but had to force it down...foie gras should not be that way.\n- The King Crab wasn't even memorable.  I was disappointed after a taste.  It wasn't bad, just nothing special.\n- La Ch\u00e2taigne soup was very bacon in flavor.  I can honestly compare it to bacon cooked on a stove top, and thrown into cream sauce.  The foie gras in the soup was overcooked as well.  I wouldn't even know it was foie gras unless I read the menu. \n- Le Veau: veal was passing.  It wasn't something I tasted and felt \""wow, I must have this again\"".  \n\nAfter we finished our \""experience\"" we felt disappointed with the food, and mentioned that it is not worth three michelin stars.  In addition, I started to feel queasy.  I thought it was the food's richness, however, if only that were it.  I spent the whole night amidst a toilet, throwing up.   I had one glass of wine, so it was not alcohol related.  Drunkedness and heart burn over food poisoning any day.  FAIL!\n\nIn my honest opinion, Joel Robuchon in Vegas is living off of its hype.  It's either politics that gave him the stars, or what it used to be.  But the quality is sub-par, so save your money, do not dine here.  \n\nSo overall:\nJoel Robuchon's Food - BAD\nFood Poisoning - VERY VERY VERY BAD!!!!	0
I have had not one but many bad experiences at this restaurant. I find that their all you can eat is crap. You can order but don't expect your food. I have gone and ordered and after not getting food I inquired and they told me to reorder. It is sad thatnyou pay a fortune and not get anything. I would hope that they would change their policy. But even after complaining on line I was told to visit their other locations. No compensation or anything. Pretty sad. I would give the satisfaction. And I am not sure how fresh everything is	0
I had a decent 6$ sandwich. That's what I can say. I read other reviews and I really went there hoping for something decent, but I felt let down. \n\nYou can't expect much for 6$ so it delivered there. But the service was terrible. 6 people in the place and the girl couldn't bother to show us more attention then the minimum requirement. The place is also dirty, quite dirty. I can handle cheap, but not a fan of dirty. \n\nSoupe soupe across the street is a better bet. A few bucks more but much better organized.	0
Was very disappointed at the lack of choices on the menus and the fact that a place focused on \""healthy and vegan friendly\"" items has Absolutely no Gluten free choices other then an omelet and tomato soup.  Food was good but not great. Probably will not eat here again.  Cute decor.	0
Negative stars need to exist for establishments like this.\n\nI have contacted the better business bureau about this location, as well as their corporate offices. Alerted them to their accusing us of walking out on our checks when we did not, then charging our card the wrong amount. All this after a four hour miserable wait and experience. I have also reported the manager Dan who has handled this so atrociously that it's astounding he has a job at all. \n\nPlease: do not eat here or support this business. I venture to guess they will be closed soon anyway; especially after the business bureau begins investigating them.	0
Havent been here in a while, so I decided to come back to actually try out the food this time. I used to come here to drink and meet up with friends. I was in the mood for a steak so I ordered the ribeye the food came out in a timely manner and the service was good . Sad to say the steak was not as good as the service . I'm a better stick myself and that is what I compared to. I felt like I ordered from a one star restaurant. I literally wanted to bring in my own cow and show them how to really make some good steak . I guess next time I'll stay in and cook my own.	0
Tried to go to Redbrick last night and found out it closed nine months ago. So if you are in Vegas and want GF Pizza, you gotta look somewhere else.	0
In a nutshell: buyer beware.\n\nThe service was friendly, the price was right... the phone was probably stolen... annnnd did not function as claimed.\n\nI hastily bought an unlocked phone from these guys 3 hours before my flight left. We were leaving to travel in Central America for a year and my phone had just died. Hence the haste and the need for a global unlocked phone. Though I realize that buying a used phone means some features are broken, they said the phone checked out. So I was very disappointed to discover that the GPS (50% of the reason I needed the phone) didn't work, the headphone jack didn't work, the back camera was missing a lens, and the front camera didn't work at all, and some other little things. So this is a phone that checked out for being fully functional?\n\nNow that I am back in the US, I bought a US SIM. I can't activate the SIM because there's a lost/stolen alert on my phone (interesting that wasn't a problem in Cen. Am.). So now I have a phone that I bought as a legitimate phone for $150 that I can't use. There are websites where you can check the phone to see if it is stolen. You'd THINK a store that deals in used phones would do that. NOPE. I trusted them. I was burned.\n\nAnd now that I'm trying to contact them again, their phone number doesn't work and they're not responding facebook messages. Thanks, Clarence of Unlocked Global Phones. You've really done me a solid, buddy.	0
I took my kids for dinner tonight. They ordered their meals and I ordered a Baja salad. They gave me my kids' food and the cashier told me they were just waiting on the chili for my salad. I went and sat down with my kids. I went back up ten minutes later to see where the rest of my order was. The cashier told me he had to have the chili checked. He yelled back for someone to check the chili. Someone in the back yelled they couldn't check it and stated they were too busy to check it. The cashier told me he would have someone check the chili in a few minutes so I stood there for another five minutes waiting. Someone then finally checked the chili and said it wasn't ready yet. By this time, my kids had finished their meals and were eating their Frosties. At that point, I told them to take the salad off my order. The cashier called the manager over and told her he needed a refund. She asked him, \""Why do we need a refund?\"" The cashier told her the chili wasn't ready for the salad. The manager handed the cashier the keys. He then told her I don't need the keys. It's on a card. (I used my debit card.) At that point, she got very angry, slammed down whatever it was she was doing and came over to do the refund. She was rude and obviously VERY angry. In fact, it seemed that every single employee there was in a terrible mood. I understand people have bad days, but there is absolutely no excuse for every person in there to be treating the customer like they are an inconvenience. If it is so inconvenient for them to serve me my food, I'll be happy to take my business elsewhere. In fact, I left there and went down the road to Quiznos for my dinner. The real slap in the face to me was the fact that there is a banner hanging up on their wall stating \""Customers are #1\"".	0
Just came here for a Mother's Day brunch.  We called the day before and made reservations for 11:00 knowing that it was going to busy.  We arrived about 5mins early and were told that the the table was just going to be cleaned up and we would be seated.  We proceeded to wait for half an hour.  We saw people get seated that had just put their names on the list while we waited, and these were parties of the same size as us (7).  Once we were finally seated we all decided to get the buffet which was kind of the special.  Once up at the buffet it got worse.  It seemed like they had been way overwhelmed. There were things on the buffet that were missing  like the prime rib, there was just a pile of the fat scraps and no one there cutting anything.  There were things that were cold and picked over as well.  Also none of the plates or cups matched, which is not really a big deal but just added to the unprofessional appearance.  I used to like going to this place when I lived here and thought it would be a good spot to take my mom.  It turned out horrible and I will never be returning here, nor recommending it to anyone.	0
Closed ! Probably to health inspectors .. disgusting inside , out dated , and wear junkies and bums hang out.. been many robberies here..	0
I ate here on my birthday when we did a group trip to Vegas. We got in late, and didn't know where to go and ended up choosing this because the baby they use to advertise was everywhere in the hotel.\n\nI've had a lot better tasting Chinese food and paid a lot less for it. The Moo Shu Pork was pretty good, but all of the other dishes we got were either too salty or too bland. They forgot about one of the dishes we ordered and didn't bring it until 20 minutes after the first plates arrived. We also had trouble getting refills on anything. This was by far the worst service I've ever gotten in Vegas\n\nI will definitely not be eating here again on any of my trips to Vegas.	0
Have been here several times since it opened. Unfortunately, this last experience was not the best. After being seated about 8:30 pm on a Friday night, our server came and took our drink order. Then, another one came and took our food order. The original server was nowhere to be seen; we figured it was because the restaurant was getting quieter, and so they sent some of the staff home. No problem. But, after that, after delivering our food, the second waiter never came back. Several people had ordered iced tea of which none were ever refilled. Only waters were refilled. After our plates were cleared, we sat for a good 10 minutes looking for server to bring us the check. Eventually we had to snag a third server to bring us the check. Disappointing. I remember when the restaurant first opened. There was a large size crowd and sometimes a long wait. Now, you can walk right in and be seated (there were 5 of us). Hopefully the service will improve, because restaurants in this area compete fiercely for patrons. I hope the smaller crowd was not an indication that this restaurant is beginning to suffer.	0
terrible food and over priced. I don't think the kobe beef burger is kobe beef, in and out burger is better and cheaper.  this place is crap	0
We're extremely huge fans of Penzey's spices.  Prior to returning home to Wisconsin, I made countless trips to the \""main store\"" in Brookfield, placed dozens of online orders, and have made road trips to Kansas City all in the name of procuring Penzey's spices.  They really are that good.\n\nBut this store in Middleton is a major disappointment for two primary reasons: the hours of operation, and the service.\n\nThe hours are a bit ridiculous... they close at 5:30pm on weekdays, and an unbelievable 5:00pm on Saturdays and 4:00pm on Sundays.  Really??  I don't know about you, but rarely am I finished shopping by 5:00pm on a Saturday... those days are usually so filled with activities that I'm doing my best to get everything finished by 9:00pm.\n\nThere's nothing more frustrating than driving over to a store with the intention of \""running in to grab\"" (something) only to discover they've closed at a crazy-early hour.  Can someone share with me why the Penzey's stores close so early?  \n\nSecond complaint: the service.  Customer service at most Penzey's stores isn't fantastic, but at this particular location, the store clerk was literally sitting on the counter, listening to the Brewers game on her radio, and seemed to be genuinely upset that we were buying $40 worth of spices from her.  The transaction went something like this:\n\nMe: \""Hi.\""\n\nHer: \""Hi.\"" (rings up spices)  \""$38.12\""\n\nMe: \""Ok, here you go\"" (hands her debit card)\n\nHer: \""Want your receipt?\""\n\nMe: \""Yes please, thanks.\""\n\nThat's it.  Not a \""thanks\"" or a \""you're welcome\"" or anything like that.  Not even a casual observation on the spices we purchased... just a \""why are you bothering me?\"" attitude.  \n\nI guess I'll order online, even though this store is literally a mile from my place... :-(  I'd give this place zero stars if possible, but the spices are good; their Tellicherry Peppercorns are amazing, as are their Chili, Taco, and Fajita seasonings.  Also, be sure to try the Foxpoint Seasoning the next time you make potatoes - it's great stuff.  Just wish the service didn't absolutely stink.	0
went on a friday night... it was EMPTY wtf.... the band playing was too loud, and the lead singer must have thougt hes Bon Jovi in the 80s.. or Axel dunno.\n\nAnyways, there were neither any guys, nor aifroce guys there. If anyone knows where to hang with airforce guys, PLEASE let me know.\n\nOur shots were way too expensive.... just saying. The other prices where ok for beer and tequilla mixers.	0
25 mins from the strip, not worth the drive. The food isn't that great and it looked like its been sitting out for awhile. The food is bland and the waiter isn't the friendliest.	0
I have the impression about Orocco Pier that the views it affords customers makes up for many the the shortfall left by the supposedly arty platings of the various dishes served. The table service we experienced was friendly and pretty efficient but price-wise, particularly for drinks, I found it lacking in value for money.\n\nThe food was generally tasty enough although I've had better ravioli. It'll be a while before I think about going back.	0
If you want  authentic Korean food, don't go there.\nThe side dishes and entree was either bland or too sweet. I guess being on the strip they must have decided to make the food sweet to appeal to non-Koreans (especially Japanese). That was the only logical conclusion I can think of because Korean food should not be sweet.\nThe kimchee hot stone pot rice came out warm with kimchee juice still on the bottom. So, I told them to take it back. It came back 10 min. Later. Still not right and warm-it should be sizzling. My soy bean (den Jang chee gae) was too sweet as well as bland. So, I called the manager but the waitress never called one for me. So, I complained to her that it was one of the worst Korean food I've had in a long time.  I am visiting from los angeles, which has one of the best Korean restaurants outside of Korea. So, I think I know what I am talking about.\nIt's so sad because I was here for super bowl Sunday. It was not bad. They must have change the cooking concept since to attract the non-Koreans. If I was alone, I would have cancelled the order and walked out.\n\nTrust me, stay away unless you like your food bland and sweet.\n\nThere are better Korean restaurant. I think Ginsang on the south side on the strip is better. The Korean restaurant on the strip pass the Stratosphere is better. The Korean restaurant in the old shopping center on Sahara, north of the strip is better.	0
I called the hotel at 6:29 to tell them I needed pickup from the airport and was told it would be 20-30 minutes. After 45 minutes I call the hotel again and am told it will be 5 more minutes. Finally at 7:26 the van pulls up. Three more minutes and it would be an hour that I waited for the shuttle. The driver is rude and we continue to sit at the airport and wait 15 more minutes. By the time I get to the hotel I have been in pit for nearly two hours, severely cutting into an already limited rest period which is slightly crucial for the people working your flights. Horrible customer service and a waste of time.	0
- die pizzen sind extrem fettig\n- oft ist falscher belag drauf oder iwas fehlt\n- das wird dann mit extra k\u00e4se vertuscht\n- hatte auch schon pizza die im kern noch roh war\n- hatte mal vergammelte pilze auf der pizza\n- getr\u00e4nke schmecken abgestanden\nIch bab schon ein paar mal gedacht,dass die evtl einfach nen schlechten tag hatten, aber die beschwerden wurden einfach ignoriert! Unversch\u00e4mt jemanden auf verbranntem essen, zutaten die vergammelt sind / auf die man allergisch ist sitzen zu lassen!	0
The must-eat for serious steakhouse enthusiasts. I've been made fun of for my love for the petite medallions (2 of 'em) and shrimp (Louisiana-style) on top, but there's nothing petite about my appetite, I kid you not. Put two of them together, and it's a luscious filet mignon meal. The cocktails are off the hook; and the delectable creamed spinach is an essential on the side. \""Ruth's Chris\"" is one of those must-once-a-year occasions, it's expensive, but a necessary splurge for any true steak lover. Note: Don't get butter on your nose like I did; the waiter won't laugh at you but your friends will.	1
I love the tomato soup and the berry salad. I get extra croutons for the soup because it's the best to dip with. The berry salad is filled with blue cheese, berries, and delicious candy walnuts. Plus, the salad dressing is made with real berries. \n\nThe wait can be long, but it's always worth it. I consider this to be one of my favorite lunch spots in Las Vegas.\n\nI want to send a extra thank you to Angelica who assisted my family. Her service was 5 star!	1
ok...we have family in town staying at the Palazzo so of course a meal at Zine was a gimme. though pricey...the food was delicious! started out with the wor wonton soup then came honey glazed walnut shrimp, pepper crusted beef tenderloin, fried rice w/shrimp & pork and sweet & sour pork...the portions were perfect...there was no take home tonight...it was all good. the place had a decent crowd for a saturday nite but we were a party of 5 without reservations and were seated within 5 minutes. \n\nhighly recommend!	1
For a small little venue, this is one of the hidden gems of Scottsdale.  The admission is normally just $10, and you buy your typical 2 drinks/item during the show.  The drinks and appetizers were very good quality, and we got served in the appropriate times of the show.  \n\nYou had a nice intimate atmosphere with the comedians.  That may mean he/she picks on you more, but it makes it more fun and entertaining.  During our show, the headliner was some famous guy from the Food Network who also did several smaller skits on HBO.  I think the comedians are very original and know how to play off of the crowd.	1
Had the Bun Bo Hue with spring rolls and a young coconut to drink.\n\nThe soup was delicious all normal condiments were provided and service was excellent! Their water has a secret in it that you just have to try. Very different from other restaurants but very delicious!	1
This is a higher end Portuguese establishment located in Vieux-Montr\u00e9al.  The service is like a dance and on point.  The food is fine dinning and creative.\n\nWe had a reservation for 6 people this past Saturday evening.  I've been told by locals that its rare that people can just walk into a place like this one on a weekend, so I advise making a reservation. \n\nPros: Presunto! Presunto! Presunto! \n\n-The food is not only lovely and delightfully pleasant to look at, but its outstandingly  delicious.  We had a number of tapas items from salads, presunto platters and assortment of traditional mussel dishes.  I was accompanied by friends who frequent this establishment, so the server had the run of the table.  He suggested a variety of tapas not on the menu.  The traditional Portuguese flavors were present with a French flair and presentation.  The menu is simple and reads in both Portuguese and French.  English menus have to be requested. \n\n-The service is on point.  The water glass was always full and the table was serviced without question.  Our server was professional and introduced the tapas plates and specials in a gregarious , flamboyant and boisterous manner.  Its in European style here and very entertaining!    \n\n-Location is the best in Montreal in my opinion.  There are other beautiful areas like the wealthy residential section of Outremont as well, but something always pulls me to Vieux-Montr\u00e9al.  There are numerous options in this area and the service can be impeccable. \n\nNow with better food and impeccable service comes in higher prices.  A dish can run from $32- $62.00.  Be sure to tip the wait staff 15-20%.	1
My brother and I used to frequent this place often when he lived in town. They have the most amazing desserts I've ever tasted. The menu changes depending on the season but it is superb. The atmosphere is very hip and modern. The service is great. Best of all, Chef Kerry Simon is very involved and is a very kind and humble guy. Love this place. Will be going back soon!	1
I was so worried this morning when the AC went out and the forecast called for Sunny, Sunny, Sunny! I chose Number 1 based off their Yelp reviews. They were prompt, thorough and affordable. I spoke with Steve on the phone and was serviced by Leon. My AC is working again and it's only 8:15am! I have their card on the fridge and will be using them again.	1
Excellent food and reasonably priced.  I had the Tomato, basil and mozzarella sandwich, which was delicious.  They gave me a cafe mocha as a challenge, saying I will never want one from that 'other' coffee shop again.  ;). It was delish as well.  I would definitely return!	1
Have driven by this place for months and finally got a chance to go.  The first time it was closed due to a family emergency.  Second try they were open - yay!  \n\nSimple menu and reasonable prices.  We decided to eat in.  There were a couple others dining in while we were there, still more came to pick up and go.  We tried the fried cod & the fried pawns.  Both came with a garlic-seasoned cole slaw.  Cod was one large piece of fish, not overly breaded.  Pawns were qty of 6, butterflied and breaded.   Ample portion of fries came with both.  \n\nWe were served by an enthusiastic owner who genuinely appreciates the business and is doing his best to serve.  Fish & chips is a nice addition to the Scottsdale restaurant line-up.  Patronize the locals and keep the money at home.  \n\nNote - they accept credit cards but VISA & MC only.\n\nThank you, Seattle's Best.  You remind me of home, but the weather is a whole lot nicer here.	1
Best out in the neighborhood in my view. Well balanced pho broth. I come here several times a week. Best 6 bucks money can buy for lunch!  I get the 114 no tripe.	1
Love love love this place. Aiden is an artist. He is such a perfectionist and truly cares about how your nails look. He is so knowledgeable and has definitely taken his time to perfect his craft. I definitely recommend him and his luxury nail salon. You won't be dissapointed!!!!	1
Very good food here. First time in nc altogether so i didn't think i could come across anything authentic. Try the salt n pepper squid and canh chua.  The vietnamese iced coffee is outstanding. Only complaint is the I'm not used to the higher price point in comparison to tx. Still a great find.	1
When we were on vacation, my friends and I came upon this place by chance. It's a no-nonsense place but with authentic Japanese food. And it was GOOD. REAL GOOD. We were the only customers in there because they were about to close. But they took our orders and never rushed us. The owners and their daughter were extremely polite. Definitely a place I'd go back to when I'm around AZ again.	1
Cheeseburger and fries were delicious! \nPrices are seasonable for the size of the burger and all the condiment options to choose from. \nService was great! Friendly and helpful staff. \nClean seating areas inside the restaurant.	1
My boyfriend was first introduced to Euro-Deli Batory by his good friend, who incidentally had lived in Poland for many years. We've since moved just down the street from this little secret of a place (not necessarily a factor in our decision), unassumingly nestled between the wood-smoke bagel shops of central Mile-End. \n\nThe menu is pretty straightforward, tacked up on a long strip above the deli counters of fresh meats and cheeses. They serve classic Polish homestyle fare, including pierogies, stuffed cabbage rolls, Polish sausage, hunter's stew, borscht, and potato pancakes. They even serve fresh (and bottled to take home, if you want) tripe soup, as well as what I term \""the man plate\"" - the \""Polski Talarz\"", which is made up of a huge medley of everything. \n\nInside, wooden walls give the impression of a small, warm cabin in the winter, ideal for the lengthy Montreal winters. A few tables are tucked to one side, and sitting beside them, a tiny grocery section filled with sweet treats. \n\nService is friendly and quick. Prices are very reasonable and the food is always cooked hot and fresh. Really, what more can you ask for?	1
Can't beat the price for an afternoon or morning of play for the kids! The new snack bar is great and I like that there are rooms for the smaller kids to play away from the more rambunctious older kids.  I wish it was closer but we'll worth the drive to let my girl run and play till she nearly falls asleep on her feet!	1
Very delicious! I'm not going to rave about all the flavor blah blah blah..because everyone already has int their reviews!\n\nThe boy and I just returned from Italy 3 weeks ago, and this place still seemed pretty authentic considering it's in Madison. \n\nWhy the 4 stars?\nThe woman behind the counter was friendly and helpful..until we asked for brewed coffee.\nShe didn't have a pot ready.\nHer response.. \""Well, I guuuuueess I could put one on for you. It'll take a few minutes.\""\n\nNot rude, just put out sounding.\nWhich was strange. Since her ENTIRE job is to serve customers their orders.\nAnd ours wasn't complicated, or annoying or even strange. \nJust wanted some coffee with our gelato.\nWe didn't wait, just took the yummy gelato goodness to go.\n\nBut really..4 very pleasant customers, 2 of whom want coffee...is that so hard/annoying?	1
Just ate here for the first time. Here are my impressions:\n\nLoved the atmosphere (much more so then 5 Guys)\nLOVED the veggie Frites. So nice to know that you can get real, fresh,        veggies at a fast food joint. We went back and got a 2nd order.\n\nChicken salad was 5 stars for a fast food joint.\n\nThe burger was good, not great. Tasted slightly greasy. Bun was yummy.\n\nI ordered the regular fries (supposedly like McDonald's original). They were ok. Could have been hotter. I guess I am getting spoiled by fries that are more like 5 Guys (fresh cut, skin on).\n\nI had a coke float with Hagan Daz vanilla ice cream in it. Very generous portion of ice cream and I got to add my own coke and keep refilling as many times as I wanted. I thought that was awesome. \n\nMy obvious comparison to 5 guys is because these are really the only 2 burger chains that are a cut above all of the rest. (Sorry In and Out, these 2 are better)\n\nSo, 5 Guys wins on the burgers and fries, but Smashburger wins in all other areas because they have ice cream, not to mention it is Hagan Daz, my favorite, milkshakes and more variety of food choices on the menu and a lot of those are healthy options.	1
Had  lovely birthday dinner here for my wife. The setting was nice although the waiter did hand me a flashlight to read the menu. With booths around the perimeter and four tables in line down the center the size was intimate, but not isolated. Service was excellent and the food was very good and nicely presented. Rating is on the high end of four stars.	1
These are the absolute best cupcakes around!  You will not be disappointed!	1
This has got to be the best Thai food in Arizona!!! My favorite is the Ginger Pork. My husband loves the Cashew Chicken. Make sure to save room for the FBI (Fried banana ice cream). The owners are friendly and come out and talk to you if they can. Great family business!!!	1
I stopped by Molly's stand in Mund's Park with my family and I could not have been more impressed with the tamales. The gentleman working that rainy morning was one of the friendliest people I came across in Arizona. While he tamales were being steamed he asked questions about my vacation a seemed genuinely interested. To top it off, the tamales were outstanding.	1
I actually really enjoy this place. It is a super cute resturaunt built from two old phoenix houses linked together.\n\nMost of the food is not spectacular but never bad. The mizithra cheese however is so good, the chicken marsala, amazing and flavorful, and the tuscan chicken sandwich (only available at lunch time) very craveable.\n\n\n\nMost of the salad dressing are made on site, and while I personally am a fan of the bleu cheese, most of my friends go for the creamy pesto.\n\nThe bread is delivered fresh daily and once upon a time long long ago when I served tables here for a short time a small loaf of bread was my nightly dinner and quite satisfying.\n\nBecause I worked here I can also tell you the kitchen staff back then was always terrific and the whole place very clean.\n\nThe price and atmosphere make this a simple and enjoyable place to grab dinner with friends...or sit with your date in the trolly.\n\nFor the small prices to get soup or salad, a drink, bread, dinner and a scoop or spumoni, what more can you ask for?\n\nAnother notable fact: the location is actually ranked as one of the top haunted places in AZ.  When I worked there the power went out one night and i swear to you we could hear footsteps up in the attic!	1
I live in a Foodie town, and sometimes while I'm in Vegas I never seem to find anything that great unless I eat at an expensive restaurant. So when I do make that choice to eat expensively I go to Smith and Wollensky...mouth is salivating now thinking about their steak with gorgonzola cheese baked on top....\n\nI love eating here and make a point of stopping by every time I'm in Vegas. You just can't pass up a good steak...	1
I am a Phoenix/Glendale native and have grown up on many of the different mexican bakeries over the past 50 years or so here in the valley.\nOur family has always kept the bakery items as a special occasional treat and we have not found any that are as good as La Purisima...we used to go to the one in Glendale...but then moved to the east valley and only got these little treats on the rare occasion we would be in Glendale...then we found the one in Phoenix!  Still far, but we will sometimes make a trip just for the pastries (pan de huevo). I am hispanic and love their tamales---(very good masa) and they have good tortillas as well.  I could continue to rave on this place forever....well worth the trip!!  Only downfall is CASH ONLY---but it's understandable during these tough times.\n\nUpdate  July 2012--the bakery is now called La Promesa--still as good--and they take credit cards now!\n\nUpdate--Name has been changed back to La Purisima and they are on a cash only system again.  Still same great quality.  Just bought my masa for our annual tamales from them again.	1
Good Persian food with quality basmati rice. Fast and friendly service. Reasonable prices.  \nI highly recommend it to everyone.	1
These guys have always taken good care of my car.  I've been coming to them for 3 years, and only one time did they miss something.  Their prices aren't bad either.  They usually have specials during the week when it's slow.	1
Mmmm... Chuck Box... Droooool...\n\nSo this place looks kind of run down, some of the staff looks a little scary, and there's literally a 1\"" thick layer of grime on the brick next to the grill that's probably taken 40 years to build up, but damn is it a good burger. This is one of those places where they go out of their way to disgust you and you still come back because the food is so good.	1
I enjoy doing business here because I always know I'll be greeted by friendly, helpful people. They provide a quality, affordable product and in a very efficient manner. I highly recommend them!	1
The food at Rosita's is great, the service fine. Their salsas set the standard for the area. The only issues with Rosita's have to do with the neighborhood and the parking. That aside, Rosita's is hard to beat for a balance of price and overall quality.	1
Cracker Barrel is an old time favorite of ours. Love the genuine hospitality and the charm and character of the place.\n\nMac and Cheese along with the hash brown casserole are amazing!\n\nLoved the Dumplings!\n\nSweet Tea is the best - especially since you can't get sweet tea here.	1
