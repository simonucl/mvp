Wanted to give there cupcakes a try.  I have to admit they are not my favorite. The cake was very crumbly and had only a slight amount of flavor.  The cream cheese frosting was gooey and messy.  I really don't feel they are worth $3.00 a pop.  Just my opinion.	0
The food here stinks! I will never go back again! Don't waste your time and money there are other restaurants with better quality food!	0
I enjoy the chicken at El Pollo Loco. I do not enjoy the wait for the chicken at El Pollo Loco and I was admittedly indifferent to the hair that I found on my chicken at my most recent visit at El Pollo Loco. I had waited for ~ 15 minutes for 3 chicken breasts and a wing (no sides, no drink) so I decided to pull the hair off my chicken, remove the portion of skin that the hair was sitting on and have at it. I will say it was still delicious albeit less than sanitary.	0
Very average - my pasta was cold,the steaks were ok but very small but the service was what really let it down.the waiter was exasperated by simple questions and when one of our party didn't get a bread roll (as they had no side plate) and requested one it was unceremoniously dumped on the table,minus a plate.i won't be back.	0
Let me start by stating I really enjoy the food here. I have been here for lunch, ordered out, and sat down for dinner and never had an issue with the food. I prefer their pizza over most places.  However, SERVICE MEANS A LOT. \n\nI have had terrible service there once in person to the point where my boyfriend wanted to walk out. Well last night I called in on my way out of work from a 12 hour shift.  I did not have much brain power left and wanted to just grab food and go home. Lets just say my phone call was very unpleasant.  I asked for pizza and ranch where the person on the phone proceeded to ask how much ranch I would like \""2 pints, half a pint, blah blah blah.\"" At this point in the day I do not have much left in my brain and was not thinking measurements I just wanted ranch. I said a cup would be fine where he proceeded to tell me \""well I do not know what that means\"" and continued to repeat himself over \""2 pints, half a pint blah blah blah\"" \n\nI then decided I would let him know I was displeased with his phone etiquette seeing he repeated himself three times when I just wanted a small container of ranch. He could have simply said \""I will show you sizes when you pick up\"" or something rather than repeating himself over when I obviously didn't understand.  When I approached him in the store he was nothing short of rude. He denied being rude and the manager stood and listened to my conversation and did not care to interject and say I am sorry for your unpleasant phone call. I paid and went to walk out and got the ever popular \""have a good night!\"" \n\nI believe I work very hard and I am pleasant to every person I come in contact with. These people are rude and unpleasant. Will never go here again.	0
Came to the Aria pool for my Birthday with my mommy friends and ate here since it was poolside. Big mistake.\nI dont know why I ordered sushi but I did and I had to send it back. It did not look good at all.\nEnded up with a chicken quesadilla..for $15 bucks.\nIt was ok..not great.\nThe overpriced drink I had was the highlight of the meal.\nI wont be eating here again.	0
Pros: Fun if you are drunk out of your mind. Or just turned 21. Or just turned 21 and drunk out of your mind. Oh, and if you are from Nebraska. Honestly though, the environment is really energetic and loud so don't expect to actually talk to anyone you are eating with. The fish and chips are good, food wise. Oh, and you can take goofy pictures, so that's fun.\n\nHint: if you walk in somewhere and they ask if you are there to drink or to eat, never eat the food. Unless you love globs and globs of cheese. The rubbery, oily kind. \n\nCons: Literally the WORST meal that I have ever paid for. Had to pay for chips and salsa. The salsa was awful. How do you mess up salsa in a Mexican restaurant? My partner ordered tacos. Only ate two bites of one taco because they were gross. Again, how do you mess up tacos in a Mexican restaurant?  \n\nI'm not too surprised because I should have known better. I mean, it's Vegas and I got a coupon for a free appetizer. There had to be a catch. Stick to the buffets, people. Your wallets and stomach will thank you.	0
First club I'd ever gone to in Vegas & I had a horrible experience. We thought we got a good deal to go in but ended up paying less at Marquee the next day & had a way better time. \n\nThis club is small & overcrowded. There is hardly anywhere to stand without being uncomfortable. The bartender completely ignored me, the free drink the club offered was weak, the security guards have huge chips on their shoulders, the dance floor is small & overcrowded. When I finally made it down there I was told by two security guards to not block the way down. Well where was I gonna go genius? I kept talking crap back to them until I had enough of this crappy club & left. They really need new employees. \nThe only plus is the good music played.	0
i went tonight and it was not crowded at all except they put my family and I with 3 drunk guys who where loud and annoying. the pod has 8 screens (4 on each side) playing the same video which is a bit too much. also, the music and videos were way too loud for such a small place. the view was only good when you got to the top, the rest of it is parking lots and roofs of buildings, which really disappointed us :( also, every single employee that we ran into had an attitude! overall, the pods are clean and air conditioned which was the only good part. this was a one time thing and i wouldn't do it again, plus it's waaaay too overpriced :(	0
My friend and I came here on December 21st for dinner after it was recommended to us by the Tix4tonight because it was close to our show's location.  We thought... meh why not? \n\nThe ambiance of the place was pretty good and the waitstaff there were very hospitable - the only aspects that prevents it from getting one star. Other than that, I would definitely not go back.\n\nThe food, first of all, was HORRIBLE.  For the price of almost $30, I've never been to a buffet more terrible than this one.  Basically, it's an International Buffet with foods: Chinese, Japanese, Latin, Italian, BBQ/roasted meats, seafoods... and of course all-you-can-drink beer, wine and non-alcoholic stuff.  The crab legs were tasteless, sushi rolls were unimpressive (rice was too hard), their Chinese food consisted mostly of North Americanized creations.  At the Italian stations, their food was lukewarm.   I've walked around the buffet many many circles to find things I'd like to eat but unfortunately didn't have too many things on my plate.  Besides the dessert station which was okay, their food selection, variety and quality was inadequate.  When tasting the food, it just doesn't taste fresh and we were both really really disappointed.	0
No bueno! I ordered a blended caramel and my husband ordered a vanilla latte. My drink taste like ice and his seriously taste like a cigarette. No joke!	0
Joel Robuchon is the \""chef of the century\"".  This place has three michelin stars, 4.5 stars on yelp, and recommended by foodies.  So naturally, after dining at a handful of michelin restaurants, we had high expectations for Joel Robuchon.  For chris sakes, Rod Stewart was sitting at the table behind us!!!  Furthermore, Joel Robuchon was in Vegas that night, and seeing him added a little extra touch.  \n\nAfter doing extensive research, my boyfriend and I opted for the two courses.  Here's our story:\n\nThe Pros:\n- Bread cart was AMAZING!!!\n- Dessert cart was awesome!\n- Amuse-bouche was yummy caviar\n- The limo ride was very much appreciated\n\nThe Cons:\nThe Food.  Aside from the above, everything was disappointing.  \n\n- Le Canard: duck was passing at best.  The foie gras on the side was overcooked. We love foie gras, but had to force it down...foie gras should not be that way.\n- The King Crab wasn't even memorable.  I was disappointed after a taste.  It wasn't bad, just nothing special.\n- La Ch\u00e2taigne soup was very bacon in flavor.  I can honestly compare it to bacon cooked on a stove top, and thrown into cream sauce.  The foie gras in the soup was overcooked as well.  I wouldn't even know it was foie gras unless I read the menu. \n- Le Veau: veal was passing.  It wasn't something I tasted and felt \""wow, I must have this again\"".  \n\nAfter we finished our \""experience\"" we felt disappointed with the food, and mentioned that it is not worth three michelin stars.  In addition, I started to feel queasy.  I thought it was the food's richness, however, if only that were it.  I spent the whole night amidst a toilet, throwing up.   I had one glass of wine, so it was not alcohol related.  Drunkedness and heart burn over food poisoning any day.  FAIL!\n\nIn my honest opinion, Joel Robuchon in Vegas is living off of its hype.  It's either politics that gave him the stars, or what it used to be.  But the quality is sub-par, so save your money, do not dine here.  \n\nSo overall:\nJoel Robuchon's Food - BAD\nFood Poisoning - VERY VERY VERY BAD!!!!	0
I have had not one but many bad experiences at this restaurant. I find that their all you can eat is crap. You can order but don't expect your food. I have gone and ordered and after not getting food I inquired and they told me to reorder. It is sad thatnyou pay a fortune and not get anything. I would hope that they would change their policy. But even after complaining on line I was told to visit their other locations. No compensation or anything. Pretty sad. I would give the satisfaction. And I am not sure how fresh everything is	0
I had a decent 6$ sandwich. That's what I can say. I read other reviews and I really went there hoping for something decent, but I felt let down. \n\nYou can't expect much for 6$ so it delivered there. But the service was terrible. 6 people in the place and the girl couldn't bother to show us more attention then the minimum requirement. The place is also dirty, quite dirty. I can handle cheap, but not a fan of dirty. \n\nSoupe soupe across the street is a better bet. A few bucks more but much better organized.	0
Was very disappointed at the lack of choices on the menus and the fact that a place focused on \""healthy and vegan friendly\"" items has Absolutely no Gluten free choices other then an omelet and tomato soup.  Food was good but not great. Probably will not eat here again.  Cute decor.	0
Negative stars need to exist for establishments like this.\n\nI have contacted the better business bureau about this location, as well as their corporate offices. Alerted them to their accusing us of walking out on our checks when we did not, then charging our card the wrong amount. All this after a four hour miserable wait and experience. I have also reported the manager Dan who has handled this so atrociously that it's astounding he has a job at all. \n\nPlease: do not eat here or support this business. I venture to guess they will be closed soon anyway; especially after the business bureau begins investigating them.	0
The must-eat for serious steakhouse enthusiasts. I've been made fun of for my love for the petite medallions (2 of 'em) and shrimp (Louisiana-style) on top, but there's nothing petite about my appetite, I kid you not. Put two of them together, and it's a luscious filet mignon meal. The cocktails are off the hook; and the delectable creamed spinach is an essential on the side. \""Ruth's Chris\"" is one of those must-once-a-year occasions, it's expensive, but a necessary splurge for any true steak lover. Note: Don't get butter on your nose like I did; the waiter won't laugh at you but your friends will.	1
I love the tomato soup and the berry salad. I get extra croutons for the soup because it's the best to dip with. The berry salad is filled with blue cheese, berries, and delicious candy walnuts. Plus, the salad dressing is made with real berries. \n\nThe wait can be long, but it's always worth it. I consider this to be one of my favorite lunch spots in Las Vegas.\n\nI want to send a extra thank you to Angelica who assisted my family. Her service was 5 star!	1
ok...we have family in town staying at the Palazzo so of course a meal at Zine was a gimme. though pricey...the food was delicious! started out with the wor wonton soup then came honey glazed walnut shrimp, pepper crusted beef tenderloin, fried rice w/shrimp & pork and sweet & sour pork...the portions were perfect...there was no take home tonight...it was all good. the place had a decent crowd for a saturday nite but we were a party of 5 without reservations and were seated within 5 minutes. \n\nhighly recommend!	1
For a small little venue, this is one of the hidden gems of Scottsdale.  The admission is normally just $10, and you buy your typical 2 drinks/item during the show.  The drinks and appetizers were very good quality, and we got served in the appropriate times of the show.  \n\nYou had a nice intimate atmosphere with the comedians.  That may mean he/she picks on you more, but it makes it more fun and entertaining.  During our show, the headliner was some famous guy from the Food Network who also did several smaller skits on HBO.  I think the comedians are very original and know how to play off of the crowd.	1
Had the Bun Bo Hue with spring rolls and a young coconut to drink.\n\nThe soup was delicious all normal condiments were provided and service was excellent! Their water has a secret in it that you just have to try. Very different from other restaurants but very delicious!	1
This is a higher end Portuguese establishment located in Vieux-Montr\u00e9al.  The service is like a dance and on point.  The food is fine dinning and creative.\n\nWe had a reservation for 6 people this past Saturday evening.  I've been told by locals that its rare that people can just walk into a place like this one on a weekend, so I advise making a reservation. \n\nPros: Presunto! Presunto! Presunto! \n\n-The food is not only lovely and delightfully pleasant to look at, but its outstandingly  delicious.  We had a number of tapas items from salads, presunto platters and assortment of traditional mussel dishes.  I was accompanied by friends who frequent this establishment, so the server had the run of the table.  He suggested a variety of tapas not on the menu.  The traditional Portuguese flavors were present with a French flair and presentation.  The menu is simple and reads in both Portuguese and French.  English menus have to be requested. \n\n-The service is on point.  The water glass was always full and the table was serviced without question.  Our server was professional and introduced the tapas plates and specials in a gregarious , flamboyant and boisterous manner.  Its in European style here and very entertaining!    \n\n-Location is the best in Montreal in my opinion.  There are other beautiful areas like the wealthy residential section of Outremont as well, but something always pulls me to Vieux-Montr\u00e9al.  There are numerous options in this area and the service can be impeccable. \n\nNow with better food and impeccable service comes in higher prices.  A dish can run from $32- $62.00.  Be sure to tip the wait staff 15-20%.	1
My brother and I used to frequent this place often when he lived in town. They have the most amazing desserts I've ever tasted. The menu changes depending on the season but it is superb. The atmosphere is very hip and modern. The service is great. Best of all, Chef Kerry Simon is very involved and is a very kind and humble guy. Love this place. Will be going back soon!	1
I was so worried this morning when the AC went out and the forecast called for Sunny, Sunny, Sunny! I chose Number 1 based off their Yelp reviews. They were prompt, thorough and affordable. I spoke with Steve on the phone and was serviced by Leon. My AC is working again and it's only 8:15am! I have their card on the fridge and will be using them again.	1
Excellent food and reasonably priced.  I had the Tomato, basil and mozzarella sandwich, which was delicious.  They gave me a cafe mocha as a challenge, saying I will never want one from that 'other' coffee shop again.  ;). It was delish as well.  I would definitely return!	1
Have driven by this place for months and finally got a chance to go.  The first time it was closed due to a family emergency.  Second try they were open - yay!  \n\nSimple menu and reasonable prices.  We decided to eat in.  There were a couple others dining in while we were there, still more came to pick up and go.  We tried the fried cod & the fried pawns.  Both came with a garlic-seasoned cole slaw.  Cod was one large piece of fish, not overly breaded.  Pawns were qty of 6, butterflied and breaded.   Ample portion of fries came with both.  \n\nWe were served by an enthusiastic owner who genuinely appreciates the business and is doing his best to serve.  Fish & chips is a nice addition to the Scottsdale restaurant line-up.  Patronize the locals and keep the money at home.  \n\nNote - they accept credit cards but VISA & MC only.\n\nThank you, Seattle's Best.  You remind me of home, but the weather is a whole lot nicer here.	1
Best out in the neighborhood in my view. Well balanced pho broth. I come here several times a week. Best 6 bucks money can buy for lunch!  I get the 114 no tripe.	1
Love love love this place. Aiden is an artist. He is such a perfectionist and truly cares about how your nails look. He is so knowledgeable and has definitely taken his time to perfect his craft. I definitely recommend him and his luxury nail salon. You won't be dissapointed!!!!	1
Very good food here. First time in nc altogether so i didn't think i could come across anything authentic. Try the salt n pepper squid and canh chua.  The vietnamese iced coffee is outstanding. Only complaint is the I'm not used to the higher price point in comparison to tx. Still a great find.	1
When we were on vacation, my friends and I came upon this place by chance. It's a no-nonsense place but with authentic Japanese food. And it was GOOD. REAL GOOD. We were the only customers in there because they were about to close. But they took our orders and never rushed us. The owners and their daughter were extremely polite. Definitely a place I'd go back to when I'm around AZ again.	1
Cheeseburger and fries were delicious! \nPrices are seasonable for the size of the burger and all the condiment options to choose from. \nService was great! Friendly and helpful staff. \nClean seating areas inside the restaurant.	1
My boyfriend was first introduced to Euro-Deli Batory by his good friend, who incidentally had lived in Poland for many years. We've since moved just down the street from this little secret of a place (not necessarily a factor in our decision), unassumingly nestled between the wood-smoke bagel shops of central Mile-End. \n\nThe menu is pretty straightforward, tacked up on a long strip above the deli counters of fresh meats and cheeses. They serve classic Polish homestyle fare, including pierogies, stuffed cabbage rolls, Polish sausage, hunter's stew, borscht, and potato pancakes. They even serve fresh (and bottled to take home, if you want) tripe soup, as well as what I term \""the man plate\"" - the \""Polski Talarz\"", which is made up of a huge medley of everything. \n\nInside, wooden walls give the impression of a small, warm cabin in the winter, ideal for the lengthy Montreal winters. A few tables are tucked to one side, and sitting beside them, a tiny grocery section filled with sweet treats. \n\nService is friendly and quick. Prices are very reasonable and the food is always cooked hot and fresh. Really, what more can you ask for?	1
