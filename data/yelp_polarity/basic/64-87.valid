My friends wanted to eat here for dinner. If I'd known what kind of restaurant it was, I wouldn't have come with them. The entire concept of backwoods decor + people being assholes, not a huge fan. Also, the food is average and overpriced. This is a place to come to when you're already drunk, that way your standards are much lower for food and respect.	0
The food was awful, the mashed potatoes were cold, the roast beef was cold even though it was carved on the spot, very few choices and for a dinner buffet i expected way more than the bland tasteless food served here.\n\nI will never recommend this buffet to anyone! Good thing I got it for free!	0
This is where Derek Zoolander eats. \n\nCame after watching \""O\"" and the music was bumping and the lights were dimmed.  Young hotties eating at each table, I definitely felt out of place...especially when the hostess gave my outfit the once over and let me stand at the counter for 10 minutes before telling me she was looking for a table for me.\n\nOnce sat, our server was really friendly but definitely looked stressed.  I don't know why, but I felt that every server/busboy looked like they were rushing around.  Too many tables for each of them?  \n\nWe settled for the kobe sliders, cold seafood appetizer, and lobster tacos for our \""meal\"".   BTW it took them 10 minutes to get back to us to take our order after we told them we were ready. \n\nThe lobster tacos are TINY but very flavorful.  The cold seafood appetizer is tiny as well but very fresh.  The kobe slider are delicious...but I love any burger.  Too bad they cooked it well done when I asked for medium rare. \n\nAfter you order, a busboy is pretty quick at taking away your plates and refilling your water but our server constantly looked busy.  \n\nOverall the food is MEH and after spending over $100 bucks at this place I felt like I stepped into an overpriced, loud, snobby nightmare.	0
OVERPRICED & OVERRATED food & service is absolutely HORRIBLE..I give it 1 star due to the decor..they sell you the buffet by making it look soo nice on the outside..the food is overheated/ undercooked & all the food that does look decent to eat, they don't put that much out there so then people take it all & then you have to wait until they make it again & bring it out 4 u..SUCKS..YUCK.. BLAH...not WORTH your time/ MONEY.. =/ I would definitely NOT come back...\n\nEven the Rio & the Paris Buffet beats this place! =/	0
DO NOT GO HERE!!!!\n\nAS always I should have listened to you Yelpers. I tried, I really did but the rest of the party I was with insisted they wanted to go here even though the restaurant next door was Moroccan and had belly dancers! ( not to mention 4 stars). Just as other people have commented, Yes there is a very annoying Italian manager that just loves to teach you about \""Brazilian steak house\"". I have a feeling he is going deaf, everything coming out of him is very boisterous and he even bends over when you place your order and yells in your ear \""WHAT?\"" The horrible part was there was an actual Brazilian in our group but the manager had no idea... he thought us so many things about \""Brazilian steak house\"" he even taught me how to drink out of a cup.  He was very perturbed when we wanted to see the menu instead of getting the \""Brazilian steak\"", \""YOU DO NOT WANT TO EAT BRAZILIAN FOOD??\"" This is because it is the most expensive thing on the menu.\n\nThe restaurant inside looks like they picked up everything at a garage sale and then put it all together in one big space. There is a huge chandelier in the middle of the restaurant that consists of 40 green desk lamps turned upside down. The restaurant also comes complete with pastel crane \""posters\"" from a 90's hotel.\n\nThe food:\nDISGUSTING.\nI ordered the Greek salad because I was scared to get anything else. They over drenched it with salad dressing and the feta was out of those President packages you get at the supermarket. The Brazilian guy we were with got the actual \""Brazilian Steak\"" which is all you can eat of different cuts of meat. \""NO DOGIE BAGS AND NO SHARING\"" barked the manager. I didn't want to eat any of his stinking meat anyway it looked like it had been recycled from day to day. One of the waiters asked my B.F if he wanted more turkey ( Brazilians don't even eat turkey) and he said \""no\"" he was full and the old geezer got mad and said that he is required to ask and that he should be polite! ok... the B.F puts up with my shit all day long and doesn't say a thing... this guy just wanted to be a dick.\n\nP.S- Even some of the other waiters were making crazy faces(LOCO) behind the managers back  when he was talking to the table!! Everyone thinks he's an idiot, even his employees!!	0
39 days until I get out of this place, and counting.  I was really excited to move in, and the staff was actually pretty nice while I was shown around and signing the lease.  That really changed after I was in.  \nThe management here has turned out to be extremely poor, and unfriendly.  Never a smile or a hello. Anything you ask of them, say a leaking faucet, and they act like they are doing a major favor for you to take care of it.  \n\nPros?  The views are nice - IF they have had the windows cleaned recently, but they are more commonly dirty.  \n\nCons?  Lack of amenities for a place this expensive.  Pool is tiny, and rarely in the sun.  1 barbecue grill that rarely works.  The gym is a joke.  Slow response to any requests to fix issues in the apartment. Unfriendly staff - avoid dealing with the so called \""manager\"", Kevin. Cold showers, or sometimes hot showers - constant problem with controlling the water temperature - that is, when you have water.  It seems they shut the water off every couple of weeks for \""maintenance\"".  Elevator issues at times, with some extremely long wait times to get an elevator. Moving in and out is a huge pain - reserving the tiny freight elevator, if it's available when you need it, then squeezing a moving truck into the narrow, smelly alley behind the building - good luck. \n\nOverall, if you want to move downtown, I highly recommend going somewhere else.  I recently looked at the new City Scape residences.  They look like a much better option, much better amenities, and everyone there is so much friendlier.	0
This is our store and they are usually really good.  But they missed it this morning - Friday before a holidaybweekend and only one register open at 10 am.  Unusually long wait	0
Wow. So they were open on Thanksgiving which was awesome. However, the food was meh. There were a few vege options, the food tasted mediocre. I would not eat here again if my life depended on it. There is so much better (like Sawad). The wall next to our table needed work - the corner was so banged up, the drywall was was coming off. There were mysterious brown stains on the wall next to me, hanging dust lines from the ceiling (have you ever been to First Ave in Minneapolis? Yea, it was like that) and it was just dirty inside. The table cloths under the glass were also stained. Save your money and go elsewhere.	0
Horrible! Waited 15 min  walked into dinning room and only 3 tables had people with 20 empty. Service was bad and super slow messed up order. Food was mediocre burger was good just needed some sort of condiment because dryness. Wings were rough on the pallet stick to original buffalo. After she took all the plates she came back  10 minutes later an asked if we were done. We had to ask for check because apparently it wasn't implied.	0
NOT a fan.  I went here for Blues Jam Night with some out of town friends.  That part of the experience was enjoyable.  My friend is a drummer and had a great time jamming out with the locals.  The mistake we made was ordering food from this establishment.  I am not sure really how this place calls themselves Vietnamese food.  I ordered the stir fried egg noodles with beef, spicy.  I am 100% they stir fried some ramen noodles with frozen peas, etc.  It wasn't spicy at all either.  It was very puzzling.  My friend ordered fried rice and I really think it was the premade frozen fried rice from Trader Joe's.  It had the ambiance of a dive bar and I think they should stick to that genre and lose the \""Vietnamese\"" food.\n\nBottom line: the entertainment was entertaining, but the food was not good!	0
BUG in my food!  WTF!!  \n\nI was here with a friend November 2011.  We were staying at HardRock anyway - so we stopped in here for dinner.  Our food came and we started eating- I WAS EATING when I noticed a weird spot on my rice - then I looked closer and it was some kind of BUG!  It was super small (still a BUG) and had tiny wings.  It was like pale greyish brown.  I was shocked!!  It was freaky, I couldn't figure out what it was!    Inside the panic and adrenaline was running!\n\nI frantically looked around - cant everyone is this restaurant see this?!  It took a few LONG minutes to flag the waitress down - then I showed her.  She looked at me, looked at the food and said very loudly \""SHUT-UP\"" (not rudely - but in an OMG - you have got to be kidding me)  she snatched up the plate and went toward the kitchen.  Im watching her like.. now what?  Finally I got up and went to go find her - where she was still lingering by the kitchen window - and i swear they were all smiling and getting a good chuckle out of this.  I told her we were leaving.  I double checked to make sure it was ok that we didn't have to pay for our meals or drinks - and she shrugged her shoulders and said it was fine.  When there is a living bug on your food - there are hundreds in the kitchen!  ADIOS Pink Taco.	0
I have been to BRGR 4 times.  The food is great and I was always recommending it and preferred it over Burgatory.  Our last visit, however, may be our last visit.  There were 4 of us - 2 of which were newbies and came on our recommendation.  All was good up until the very end.  We had paid our check and were sitting there chatting NO MORE THAN 5 minutes when our server informed us that they needed our table and requested that we leave.  Granted, we were offered a to-go milkshake but, in my opinion, that HARDLY makes up for the embarrassment and humiliation of being asked to leave a restaurant for ANY reason.  I would have certainly understood more if we had been sitting at our table for 20-30 minutes - but 5 minutes?  Really?  We will miss you BRGR - but I simply refuse to be treated that way no matter how busy you are.  And you weren't even all that busy.  Bottom-line - good burgers and food but they are more into turning tables over than making their customers feel valued or caring if they ever return.	0
Remember the saying, \""If it sounds too good to be true, it typical iS?\"" That is EXACTLY right with the IP. I will * N E V E R * stay at this place again, even if it was a \""deal\"" as compared to other hotels.\n\nShuttle service from the airport is at the back end, and have to hike a bit to get into the hotel from the heat (and away from sweaty bodies). Waited in 'the line from hell' for EXACTLY 52 minutes, 18 seconds (yes, I timed it just to see how long it would take when I saw the line). Get this: FIVE check in windows, TWO clerks, and ONE of them kept walking away from the desk to do something else..UGH. Reminded me of some banks; just waiting to see if my clerk put out the \""back in 30 minutes\"" as I got to her window.\n\nGot checked in by a very friendly clerk; apologized vehemently about the long line and wait. Kudos to her. Got to the elevator (Towers 1 & 2), pushed for a ride to the 3rd floor. Waited.....waited.....pushed the button again....waited...waited....heard a \""CLUNK\"" and then up-up away, we went. Luckily I was the FIRST ONE off of the ride! \n\n** NOTE ** I haven't paid much attention to other elevators, but I DO know that this is the FIRST elevator I've been on that actually has a THIRTEENTH (13th) floor (button)!\n\nFigured I'd share that with you 'superstitious types;' you're welcome.\n\nNever realized how much of a HIKE it would be to get to my room! After what seemed to be my warm up for a 5K, I FINALLY got to my room, noticing there were another set of elevator doors less than 50 feet away from my room! After asking a housekeeping-type person, came to find out she DID NOT KNOW WHERE THE ELEVATORS WENT! I like adventure, but not that much, especially in a dark, damp, dank hotel (that I've seen so far).\n\nGot to my room, opened the door (NON SMOKING SIGN AFFIXED) and walked into an invisible cloud of musty cigarette smoke and an overpowering odor of what seemed to be a toilet that had not been flushed....FOR A WHILE.  Absolutely NOTHING will excite your olfactory nerves than urine-based ammonia with the musty smell of an old bowel movement. Trust me...I'm NOT exaggerating. Visions of the human litter box that had not been dumped, cleaned and returned to the corner came to mind.\n\nAfter cutting in line at the front desk (there was NO WAY IN HELL I was gonna wait another hour or longer to talk to someone about this), I was moved to another room. Not expecting anything other than a move, a few persons stated they were surprised I was not 'comped' for the inconvenience. Oh well...\n\nRoom two. Got there. Opened the door, and although the 'litter box had been dumped, cleaned and refilled (no odors) the musty smell of old cigarette smoke prevailed. Beds were comfortable 'enough, ' I guess. Pretty basic setup; only four (4) channels to watch (who watches tv in a hotel anyway, right)?\n\nI will admit, the room was cold. I like cold air much more than 'room-temperature' air, especially when sleeping. On the other hand, I (literally) held my breath after using the bathroom and flushing the toilet. Instead of the water going DOWN, it began RISING!!!! The water was spinning in the right direction, but coming UP! Just as the water started to touch the rim of the toilet bowl, it went down. I've noticed that each time I've flushed (maybe I should have used the litter box?).\n\nI had a medical conference to attend @ Ceasars Palace (across the street) and was gone all day. Out the door by 7am and back by 530, ready to collapse, take a nap and wander around later that evening.  Each and EVERY DAY I returned, my room had NOT been cleaned, nor the bed sheets changed or bed made!\n\nTried ...no no, I DID call the front desk. Guess what? THEY DO NOT ANSWER THE FREAKING PHONE!! I had to walk back to the desk to talk to them about this. They kindly informed me: The front desk phones at the Imperial Palace are NOT answered at the IP. They are answered by staff at THE FLAMINGO!\n\nMoving ahead a couple of days (I paid for a 6 day stay here for my conference); after returning to my room again, the SAME situation! I approached a Housekeeping-type-person who had pushed a cart into a laundry room and was placing towels on the cart. I asked the 'housekeeper' if he could clean my room when he surprised the HELL outta me! I will quote this housekeeper (said his name was \""Joey.\""\n\nHe smiled, looked down to his cart and looked back up to me saying \""Sir, I can't help you with that. Housekeeping here is outsourced. We've had problems with them ever since they started working here.\""\n\nGet this: I go BACK to the front desk, speak to a Hotel Front Desk Manager, share this information (with FOUR other hotel guests that came with me with the same problem). She informed us quickly \""Sir, we do not have anyone in Housekeeping named Joey.\""\n\nIf that wasn't bad enough, the restaurants all close by 9pm (not ONE advertisement states this)! Pretty dang bad when they have to refer you to ANOTHER HOTEL VENUE to eat at a restaurant!\n\nDO NOT STAY @ IMPERIAL PALACE!	0
This isn't a good nightclub. They don't take care of their customers. No access to water (fountains or water station), no ear plugs available (from bar, security, or bathroom concierge), don't honor drink tickets issued upon entry. The staff is indifferent, all for $50 of cover if you haven't called ahead. If clubs serve, they should be good hosts and at least help you sober up. Haze isn't one of them.	0
Just not very good. First off it's the only buffet in Vegas where I had to walk through a quarter mile long hallway through meeting and convention spaces to get to. Not sure why they wouldn't put this off the casino so people would actually know it's there and could find it easily.\n\nThe food was mediocre. It was all well seasoned but a lot of it tasted like it was using sub par ingredients and some like the spicy macaroni and cheese tasted processed. There is a very small selection of seafood as well so if you're the type to try and load up on shrimp and crab than you will be disappointed. The shrimp comes in containers with two small shrimp a piece and there was no crab. No prime rib either.\n\nThe service would have been good but we didn't get our drinks until after we had already finished eating. Overall I wouldn't recommend this buffet at all. I've had better ones at old dingy Vegas casino's. This is the Cosmopolitan, a five star joint. I still think the Buffet at the Wynn is the best in town.	0
The pizza crust was paper thin, and the pizza wasn't seasoned very well.  I thought the pricing was a bit high for the quality of food.  Definitely not a Grimaldi's quality pizza.  I doubt I'll come back.	0
There was a little bit of line.  Came here for frozen hot chocolate for $14.00, for small glass. Too sweet and overprice!  Didn't really like the looks of then food from other people's table.  Portion was huge and nothing really stands out.  I guess people who likes quantity than quality love to go there.  I think this place is overrated.  Thanks!	0
Never again.\n\nI brought my children here while we were visiting Montreal for American Thanksgiving.  The food was okay - my older child loved her chicken marsala, but the younger one was not thrilled with her fettucine alfredo, and my veal in mustard sauce was less than stellar.\n\nThe problem was the service.  The waiter kept speaking to my children in French, even though I had told him at the beginning of the meal that they don't speak the language.  After being gone from the city for 17 years, my French was passable, and I could understand what he said, but it's incredibly rude to address patrons continually in a language they don't understand, when you have been told as much and you speak their language.  It took nearly half an hour for the waiter to take our orders, another 45 minutes to get our food, and we never received the bruschetta we ordered as an appetizer.  And adding insult to injury, we were charged for my children's refills on soda.  The restaurant should absorb the cost of such things, considering it cost less than a quarter and they charged $2.50 per.  \n\nI would give this place zero stars if I could.	0
Meh.\n\nJust the branding of the name and located in Vegas Strip.\n\nI got gelato ice cream and it was overpriced. It was good, but a small scoop for nearly 6 bucks wasn't worth it to me. The flavor was not even an exotic one: Chocolate Hazelnut.\n\nIt's a cute store with a lot of things for display, but really alright for me.	0
I recently came here for a thermal wrap that I purchased from living social. It was unprofessional from the get-go. When I called  to make an appointment she kept me on the phone for ten minutes explaining how frustrated she was with living social and that the wrap won't do anything-- I needed to purchase a package for 8 sessions to see results. It just got worse when I got there. I arrived a few minutes early to my appointment and was unsure where to check in so I peaked my head into her suite where the appointment was and said, \""hello?\"". She didn't even say 'hi' she just said, \""Oh don't come in yet, I'm not ready\"" and hurriedly shut the door.\n\nWhen I was ready to come in she made me undress in front of her stating, \""It's ok I've seen lots of bodies, it's like I don't even see them anymore. I've even had whole families in here naked for spray tanning before. It's pretty cool.\"" (What??) I was not properly draped and felt uncomfortable. \n\nThe wrap consisted of being lightly swiped over with exfoliating gloves, then rubbed (barely touched) with the lotion. She then put a fleece blanket, heated blankets, and some thermal blanket that looked like a space blanket and let me 'bake' and put on Christmas music.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes she came back in and took off the blankets and put a cold pack on me to 'cool me off' (I was already freezing from the blankets coming off and this made me feel nauseous) She lifted up the little fleece blanket (the only thing covering me) and fanned me with it, making me feel exposed once again. The only good thing was the five minute massage she gave me at the end.\n\nDurring all of this  let her cell phone ring not once, not twice, but 5 separate times on loud and answering it as she walked out of the room (apparently she hasn't figured out how to put it on silent?) \n\nI purchased one as a gift for a friend as well and was refunded my money because I didn't want to subject anyone I know to that.  She claimed to be an expert at spray tanning, though. Maybe she should just stick to that.	0
Have always loved their smoothies. \nNever been much of a fan of the food....rather flavorless. \nThe staff is primarily incompetent and aloof.\nToday, they were rude to my daughter...and then to me.\nProbably a safe bet that we will not be returning.	0
The fish seemed fresh but the rice was undercooked or at the very least overly toothy. That's got to be a cardinal sin of some sort. Service was friendly, however and the atmosphere cozy.	0
I have gave this place two chances. First time ordered a Patty Melt, which was not on Rye bread and had American Cheese....INCORRECT! Second time I ordered Chiki Dogs, they were horrible, I couldn't even finish them.	0
The service is HORRIBLE. Food is okay.. My last choice if I want quick sushi. They always mess something up.	0
Ive eaten at your location since you arrived in the Concord area.   I will never eat there again.   Your mgr Matt,  hung out at the bar socializing never to check on the the guests on the floor.  When he finally decided to come to out table,  he no concern or care about our experience.   He continued like a robot giving us a book answer over and over and never let us speak.   Never had a problem with any other mgr or staff.   I will never return because of this mgr. They need to keep him in the back where he does not need to interact with the public.	0
Ok, time to bring these reviews down to reality.\n\nNote: I am not an Hawaiian food expert so if you are, take that into consideration.\n\nThis Resturant has Kitchen nightmare written all over it.  The Resturant itself is in TOTAL disrepair.  Lights and air conditioning don't work, the carpet is filthy, the tables are scattered with outdoor lawn chairs, cables hang from the ceiling, decor is beyond decayed.\n\nFOOD: based on reviews here, I had the Hawaiian plate.  The pork had over 1 pound of pure fat in it.   Maybe that's the Hawaiian way, but for me it looked totally disgusting.   My wife had the teriyaki bowl.  Parts of it were burnt and afterwards she was complaining her stomach hurt.  Rice was ok.\n\nDETAILS\nResturant:  1/10 (this ain't homey -- it's rundown)\nAmbiance:  1/10 (scary!)\nService: 5/10 (a little slow but friendly)\nCleanliness: 1/10 (board of health should be concerned.)\nFood: 1/10 (we were trying to determine what was editable. Not good.)\nRestroom: don't know.  I was too scared to go in.\nParking: 4/10 (small lot)\n\nOverall quality seemed to be totally lacking.	0
Stayed here for one night recently and it is nothing special. The men's room at the pool had a nauseating stench pouring out of it, the air conditioner in my room didn't work, it took over 40 minutes to check in, the customer service was really lacking, the pillows were the quality of a Motel 6. It is cheap and pretty centrally located, but I would rather spend a little more to have better amenities and services. Also was extremely bothered by the lack of security at the elevators. Won't be back.	0
Kinda overpriced and the food is very average. The orange was really good, it tasted like fresh squeeze.	0
Went back to Serendipity 3 and tried the Peanut Butter Frrrozen Hot Chocolate this time.  While it was good and tasted like a Reese's peanut butter cup, I still liked the regular double chocolate one much better.\n\nI was thinking that after a year, maybe things got better here with service.  Time wise, it actually got worse!  My friends and I were there, got our orders in about 10 mins, finished our food in 20 mins, but didn't actually leave the place till another hour later because our waitress disappeared on us.  Time is short when you're visiting Vegas, and we might have spent one hour too much over there.\n  \nSorry Serendipity 3, I have to downgrade you to 2 stars.  Step it up next time to get 5 stars!!!	0
Rather unimpressed. We got our fish tank and our first several waves of fish from here. The cookie cutter advice we received here led to the death of our fish over and over again. We finally went to a mom and pop aquarium shop where we got good advice and healthy fish, now they're thriving. \n\nAs far as service nearly every time we went in we had to go hunt someone down to help us. I mean you'd think someone would keep an eye out near the aquariums for folks who need help, I can't just grab my own fish from the tank.....	0
Totally a zero star place. I can't believe this kind of clinic exist. I just needed a quick physical exam and I couldn't make appointment anywhere else. I should've known better. They take walk ins. That just shows you this place isn't really what I think doctor office should be.\nVery shady looking. Makes you not wanna give them your information...\nAll paper work is printed out from crappy copy machine I can hardly read and some letters are cut off...\nSo far I've been waiting little over 1hour.\nReceptionist looks super busy, obviously short stuff. Taking 1hour to take my ID copied is a joke. Workers yelling at each other from back to front of the office... Very unprofessional. I guess this is exactly what you expect from this kind of place.\nPaper work everywhere on desk... Mess.\nI wish I read yelp review before I came down here.\nI haven't even seen a doctor yet but it doesn't matter anymore. I'll see her/him for 10min and I'm sure anyone can do exam just fine but overall experience at this point is like negative 3stars:(\n\nSeriously. Wait 2month to get an appointment with real doctor would be my best suggestion.	0
Nothing special at all.\nThe food is flavorless\ni came to eat here 3 different  times\n just thought maybe they had a bad day\nbut 3 strikes and im out.\n\nthis place is terrible\nit just seems like they are getting lazier and lazier \nfrom the flavorless food to the lousy service.\n\nhigh prices for cheap food and crappy service.	0
As previously stated, food is marginal at best! I specifically asked the server (who was one of the owners) if their burgers were frozen or pre made, she said no. It absolutely was a pre frozen burger, you can always tell, and cost 13.00 to boot.  So don't go for the food. The drink specials seem to be pretty good, and there are plenty of TV's for all the sports fans.  Service was fair, very friendly and food came out pretty fast, but you will wait for your check and sometimes your drink refills.  The two times we went there was only one person serving the whole place and making drinks, managing the bar etc.	0
Pros = Nice looking place, decor is pleasant.  Also, we got a nice discount from the manager after our experience (see below.) \n\nCons = Just about everything else.  Our server was nice, but her service was slow.  The food took over an hour (not exaggerating) to get to us, and the food (that was actually what we ordered... Some was messed up) was over-cooked.  Also, for a BBQ place, they seem to have some sort of issue with barbecue sauces.\nRibs, Brisket, and sandwiches were ordered, and everyone got one half-filled ramekin of BBQ sauce each, that's it.  The Mac and cheese was good, although a little bland.  The collard greens were OK, but nothing any home cook couldn't do better with.\nGoing back to the lack of sauce for a minute, when asked for more sauce, they brought out a plate with 3 more half-filled ramekins on it, explaining they were the \""Q1, Q2, and Q3 sauces.\""  when asked what that meant, we were told they are three different sauces... Great, thanks! \n\nIf you live in Vegas, you already know to go to Lucille's or Rollin' Smoke for your BBQ.  Let the tourists deal with this place.	0
I'm not usually one to take to the internet and complain, but this Wells Fargo branch severely disappointed me today, especially compared to experiences I've had at other branches in the greater Phoenix area. The wait was long, and the service I received was sub-par at best.  Furthermore, the lack of communication on the teller's part left me feeling like I'd been duped by the end of the transaction, despite how clear I was initially about what it was I needed. I would have appreciated some sort of heads up before that teller took matters into his own hands just to get me out the door quicker. This may just be frustration speaking, but I can definitely say I did not have a good experience at this branch, and probably won't be back anytime soon.	0
Its basically a wanna-be fine-dining restaurant/deli open during select hours for the yoga chicks upstairs. The food lunges outside the box, and aims to be a bit pretentious. But honestly its just a rich man's Jimmy John's with better furniture and House music.	0
I walked in to get information.  The only worker there was a trainer that told me he was finishing up a private lesson and would be right with me. After 15 minutes of walking around looking  at their displays and not finding any infomation on their services and the trainer not acknowledging I was still waiting..I left.  I understand he was in a private lesson.  However, he should have given me a timeframe  or at least asked what I needed.  If you only have one person working in the store, you have to come up with a better system or have information that someone can take with them.	0
Never have had a problem with Wingstop before until going to this location. First I was annoyed when the boy taking the orders told us mango habanero was not available for whatever reason. Then he only gave us one drink with our 10 strip combo & we usually get two drinks. Then I sat down to wait for my food and one of the bus girls proceeded to tell me I couldn't sit at the table I was sitting at because it was \""closed\"". Closed? Really? But the table next to mine isn't closed? Hm, okay. Then throughout the rest of our meal the girl was moving around tables and mopping. I get that you are closing in an hour or so but moping next to people eating is never okay. I will not be going to this location again.	0
Wish I could give zero stars. I took my car here because it is close to my house. My car was damaged when they were finished. I pointed it out right away and the person drying my car got a manager. The manager told me that it was impossible that the damage was from the car wash, and proceeded to tell me how someone right before me was complaining about the same type of damage!!! Unbelievable.	0
Everyone in our family caught this stomach bug that is going around.  All four of us were up the entire night vomiting.  To say the least, it took everything for me and my son to walk into this urgent care clinic. \n\n When we arrived there was not anyone in the waiting room (I thought Yes!, we should be out of here in no time).  My insurance just changed and I did not have my card mailed to me yet.  When I walked up to the counter, the receptionist asked how she could help us.  I told her that my son and I were both there because we were sick.  She quickly asked me if I had insurance.  I gave her a paper with the information on it in hopes she could assist me with it.  She looked at me and said, I cannot take this.  I told her I knew that I needed to get the member number.  She responded, well I can't do that for you.  Ok, what do I need to do? Just let me know so we can get seen.  Again, no assistance.  She looked at me like I was asking her to go way outside of what she is allowed to do.  As I took my paper back, she made another comment about how I needed to get the information. I turned around and said, we are going to another location.  She then said, ok do you want your ID?  Her last response as I was walking out the door with my son, \""Have a nice Day'.  It was said in a very rude manner and I was completely floored by this.  This was an absolute terrible experience.  Luckily, I found another urgent care down the street who was able to help us.	0
I found this business via Yelp.  Great reviews so I went on a whim.  This is NOT the place to go, 1. near or at lunch time, and, 2. if you only want a quick oil change.  I specifically said I didn't want my tires rotated (I am actually getting new tires tomorrow morning!) but they did it anyway and the counter guy argued with me.  He said it didn't take any \""extra\"" time which I can't believe.  I was there OVER an hour and while I appreciate all the 'extras,' I wasn't told it would take so long.  They even applied my insurance company's sticker on my window.  The women working the counter exited for lunch and there was virutally no customer 'service' while I was waiting.  Then their printer broke and I had to wait for that to be fixed as well. \n\nHoping I got a fluke bad experience.  I might go back for service work but not for an oil change.	0
Perhaps the lunch slices are different from the normal fare but this place just doesn't do it for me when it comes to pizza.  The crust was the biggest let down, grade-school cafeteria-esque.	0
We found glass on the lemons that were brought for our water. That's bad enough, but when I pointed it out to the manager he just told me that they threw the lemon slices away. No compensation...no offer for dessert. Nothing else! Glass??? The food was so-so and overpriced, no rice or beans with the fajitas, chips and salsa are extra... Who's ever heard of that with Mexican restaurant? I think they just take advantage of people that come to the Boulders or are in the area vacationing. I would look elsewhere for Mexican restaurant!  (I thought the waitress was nice, however.)	0
CROOKS! Do not work with them! Everything seemed fine and dandy. Till I moved in. They made a video of the home, making it look beautiful and since I was searching from out of state, it seemed like they were so helpful. And then I got to the house. Discovering it hadn't actually been cleaned in 8 months. There was so much wrong with it. They lied to me about the condition and the HORRIBLE neighborhood it was in! \nThen when I tried to get out of it they took $900 and said it was non refundable. \nAs soon as I said we didn't want to live there they stopped the kind service and stopped caring and stopped responding. \nNot worth it!	0
I feel like this place should be rated in WTF's instead of stars because if I was rating in WTF's this place would have like, the highest score of all time.\n\nI went in with a pretty large group at lunch time and my they were eager to eat all of the sushi. So it's not like we were wasting their time. I mean, lunch time... restaurant... hungry people: It all made perfect sense!\n\nWe waited several minutes to be acknowledged. WTF? \n\nOnce the hostess came out of the back we noticed she was on the phone. WTF? \n\nAmazingly, she looked at us and went away again without acknowledging us. WTF?\n\nWhen she came back she was still on the phone. Really? WTF.\n\nThen she pointed and grunted towards the dinning room. WHILE STILL ON THE PHONE. Seriously?\n\nWe sat and she gave us one menu. ONE. There were 5 of us. We had to ask for more menus when we saw her again. She was still on the phone, and without a word she went and grabbed like 2 more menus and kind of threw them at us. WTF? I can't believe that was even real life.\n\nAt this point we were all just madly uncomfortable. Like what if we wanted to ask her for something more complicated than a menu... like SUSHI? She was still on the phone when we walked out and barely glanced at us. WTF.\n\nI guess I can't say anything about the food because I was too busy WTFing to order any. But I definitely wouldn't go back so it doesn't matter if the food is the best. If I want service this terrible I can eat at home where my private cook is NEVER around.\n\nThat is like 8 WTF's in the condensed version of this story. That is like 1 WTF/ minute for this place! Great job!	0
While there wasn't anything terrible about my dinner here, there wasn't anything terribly memorable either. I went for a date with my boyfriend on a Monday night after purchasing a Groupon. I enjoyed the stuffed mushrooms and my rotolini, and my boyfriend liked his veal. But nothing jumped out at us as amazing. Over all, we were very glad to have purchased the groupon, because otherwise we would have been very unhappy to pay the seriously over-priced bill. The service was about the same as the food....not terrible, but lackluster.	0
I felt that the Caesar salad (for $12) was extremely overrated. I wanted to see what all the hype was about at Honey Salt. Ordered a carafe of wine....mediocre wine and it was $24. The service was slow and lacked in personality. I don't like to be \""bothered\"" but she never came by. \nI didn't know that I'll go back.	0
Well, this definitely is no Capriotti's. I hate when sandwich shops totally disregard the importance of bread. Bread. Its more than the transport mechanism for meat, people. So many places cheap out and serve us basic flavorless bread substance, and continue to serve it even after its gone a bit hard and stale. I effing hate that. \n\n*Bread - yuk. I had to peel most of it off and toss the hard ends. Thanks.\n*Tried the chipotle cheese steak and the king cheese steak - decent, but won't bring me back. Jalapenos don't take the place of sweet/hot Italian peppers. Sissy-level heat.\n*Service - great, but can't compensate for mediocre food.	0
Their food is OK but the employees are a bunch of idiots and rude people. They don't ask for what you want and they get bitchy if ask for anything like salsa for your tacos! We won't be coming back here ever. They need a manager.	0
The obvious appeal of Mums is its non-conformist, diner-ish vibe coupled with an uncomfortable blown-up photo of a married couple (or mother-son duo?) that absorbs your attention like a Garry Winogrand pic. (\""Who are these people? Why am I creeped out so much? WHAT COULD IT MEAN?!?\"") Thankfully, such decorations were able to distract me from my food.\n\nOkay so not all of it was bad. The shepherd's pie was tasty (if small) and I have to appreciate joints that write their current craft beer offerings on a chalkboard. Speaking of beer, though, the Scottish ale recommended to me was bland and flat, and my side of veggies (peas, carrots, and corn) came canned and heated \u00e0 la microwave. Given the wee size of my pie, most of my meal was quite a let-down.\n\nMy disappointment led me to skip the pudding, but based on other reviews, if I'm ever back at Mums I'll just stick to the bangers and mash.	0
I would give this place a 0 star rating but it won't work so anyway, this place is awful. The girls working in there are rude. Talking smack about customers behind the counter. Appalling. I will never go back there again. Worst customer service in the world!	0
I enjoyed the atmosphere and the selection on the menu, as it offers food you cant really find anywhere else in the C-U.  I thought the menu items were decently priced, maybe a bit overpriced for the quantity and quality of the food.  \n\nI ordered three tapas dishes - the grilled plantains, the goat cheese, and the beef tacos.  The goat cheese was fried and served with honey and bread and it was absolutely delicious!  The plantains were pretty plain, but still a nice change of pace from what I normally eat day to day.  The beef tacos were tasty, but they were incredibly hard to eat when served in dry corn shelled tortillas.  They cracked and fell apart so it was a bit frustrating to end up having to eat a taco with a fork.  \n\nOur service was absolutely terrible, I had to flag down the host at one point to get my water glass refilled, and she brought out all of our food at different times which was a bit strange.  \n\nOverall, I was happy with the food I ordered and how it was prepared and how it tasted - were talking about Champaign, Illinois, not Chicago or New York - and unhappy with the service.  I wouldn't tell someone not to go there, because it is a unique restaurant for this area, but I would be warned that the service will likely be disappointing.	0
So when my friend Kevin and I are looking for a beer fix, this is usually where we head. They have decent deals on pitchers and oh so edible salsa (personally I like the hot version) but that is where the love affair ends. And even though we have gone to this spot several times, I wouldn't say that either one of us are fans. We go for the convenience.\n\nI've tried several items on the menu and have to say I've never been particularly impressed with any of them. That's a nice way of saying I've never had anything here that wasn't done better somewhere else. I have spent years learning the nuances of what makes a good Mexican plate and if you are looking for something authentic, this wouldn't be my first choice. On the other hand if you are happy with an Americanized version and in need of cheap beer, definitely check it out!	0
Rude loss prevention officer.\nNever in my life have I gotten the evileye in such a way.\nDid not feel welcomed in this store at all!\nCame looking for a specific digital camera, they have agents to spare but no one approached to help.\nGot plenty of attention when I reached into my pocket to get my phone though. Suppose I'm not important enough to help,only to observe to prevent theft.\n\nI was not gonna go to this store to start with.\nCalled in advanced to see if the product was in stock. I was on hold two different calls,two different days,different times of the day.\n\nI rather suffer dealing with Walmart staff or waiting for it to come by mail.	0
UNBELIEVABLY RUDE SERVICE. If you want to be ignored completely for simple things such as water please eat here. If you want to call to ask a question and the person that answers yells at you please call here. Enough said. Can take my love of pho else where.	0
As much as I like the breakfast at McDonald's, I will no longer be going to them. WHY? One reason, their Wi-Fi. It is without a doubt the absolute worst on the planet. Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks are fantastic but McDonald's is very, very, very bad.	0
Please do not waste your time coming here for glasses.  I can't speak to their doctors because I didn't get my exam here, but I can speak to their salespeople, pricing, and choices.\n\nI came here because they had a BOGO deal going on and I really needed a new pair of glasses and figured I would get some prescription sunglasses while I was at it.\n\nWhen I first walked in, everyone was friendly enough.  I was really underwhelmed by their selection of glasses, but managed to find a pair of sunglasses that I was okay with and a set of frames for regular glasses that would be all right.  \n\nWhen I sat down to talk about lenses, I was not asked what type of lenses or treatments I wanted.  The salesman (I don't know what his name was) just said that they would do the glare resistant.  I asked how much that would be and he quoted me roughly $350 (this was a BOGO deal, mind you, so he was quoting me a price for JUST the crappy $100 sunglass frames).  I said I could do without the glare resistant treatment and that I just wanted basic lenses...he reluctantly took it off.  Then he said \""Okay so then you'll have regular lenses in the eyeglasses and polarized in the sunglasses\"".  So again, I asked him to quote me the price.  It knocked it down to about $310.  I told him that I wasn't in the market to spend upwards of $300 on one pair of glasses and that I would just take my business elsewhere.  Only then did he give me a quote for BASIC LENSES, which is what I asked for in the first place after being quoted such a high price.  Finally he told me it wouldn't be more than about $220 with basic lenses, and I agreed.  When he rang me up, it was closer to $250, but I was so tired of dealing with him that I just paid.  I was told to come back in a couple of hours and BOTH pairs of my glasses would be ready to go.\n\nMy sister and I walked around the mall for the two hours that it would take for the glasses to be ready.  I wasn't feeling great about the purchase because I felt like the options were limited and I just wanted to get out of there so badly because of the salesman's attitude.  We stopped in to LensCrafters, and I saw way more options for around the same price, and I liked them much better.  I was quoted $320 for designer frames and completed lenses on a pair for eyeglasses and sunglasses NOT during a BOGO sale.  I figured I would pick up my glasses at VisionWorks and if I ended up disliking them I would return them and go elsewhere another day (luckily they do have a 30 day money back guarantee).\n\nWhen I got back to VisionWorks to pick up the glasses, I was told that the tinting machine was broken and that I would have to pick up the sunglasses tomorrow.  I live across town from the mall, and after my poor experience with the man who had helped me earlier, I just asked for a full refund.  They gave it to me, but not without trying to get me to take the eyeglasses home.\n\nThis place was MUCH better when it was Eyemasters, and used to be the only place I bought my glasses.  After today, I'll never go here again.	0
Terrible service, came in at 9:27 PM with eight people, place was empty and they said kitchen closes in three minutes and were quite rude!  We left and went to Firefly that was quite busy and had wonderful service and food there!  These place will go out of business because of poor service!	0
ghetto walmart from hell\n\nstore is actually pretty nice inside\n\nstaff is friendly\n\nbut....... the creepy people that approach you in the parking lot are enough to keep me from ever coming here again\n\nseriously a minimum of two people are lurking next to your car when you come out, and they are quick to get nasty with you if you don't have any change to give them	0
I ordered the new cheesestake burger combo first time no steak no baked bun as advertised called mgr to complain. I ordered a big carl last week stale bun and one piece of cheese to much sauce sloppy burger.	0
This place takes wayyyyy to long. Usually Starbucks even when they are busy are quicker.	0
Terrible to no d\u00e9cor, very dark and this was at 5:45 pm for a family dinner. We ordered 2 large pizzas and a calzone. Food was very average, no reason to return. Have been to many of Carmines restaurants but will stick with Ventanos for nice d\u00e9cor, quality food and fair prices.	0
Would have given it one star if it weren't for Calvin Harris and my friends. I was on a highly respected persons guest list for wet republic and when we got there we walked up to some goon worker to ask where the guest list line was, and he dismisses us, didn't look at us and said \""it closed at 2\""  and i said \""its 5 minutes after 2\"" and this loser mocked me and and talked in a girl voice and said \""Oh! I didn't know that omg!!\""  Really loser? I told him whose list i was on and he pretended to not know who he was. It's my 25th birthday and I'm here with 5 beautiful women and this is how you treat your guests? So i called my contact and he told me to go straight in, to which the same loser employee would not let us go!! We ended up waiting two hours in line and had to pay a ridiculous price , and only saw calvin for 30 minutes. Every person who worked there was so rude. I had a horrible experience. Will never go back there. The pool is filthy, the drinks are overpriced, and i would over look all of that but i will not overlook rude disgusting employees. I am so polite and they made sure my birthday was horrible. If i spent all that money, i better be treated well. And i wasn't. Too bad.	0
This place is a joke. Second time I've been in here and they have charged me for items placed on my plate. I was charged $2.50 for small dribble of onions $2.50 and for refried beans which I ate in four bites. They charged me for rice and green Chile.  By the time I got out of there with a ice tea drink I was charged over $20 for a very simple small meal. The waitress was running from one area to the other area and was extremely slow getting to our table. There was nobody attending the bar area and we were there for 30 minutes and never seen anybody in that area.	0
Even though I loved the location on Camden (now CLOSED) I really visited this store more!  Very impressed with the always friendly and helpful staff... Went to search the back for (never on display this season in this store) what I affectionately refer to as \""speedos\""  - when you say that word most everyone knows what you mean and if you know me, you know how serious I am about immodest swimwear (not too immodest though) square cuts and competition \""briefs\"" (old school 1980's).  No Jammers! - Forget those baggy-saggy ___ and board shorts are boring!  Back to the back (of the store) they look for me and found a box of \""speedos\"",  they looked good though only navy and black...  \n\nMore on American Apparel - Great service and I like the jeans a lot too, though not the new \""high-waisted\"" ones!	1
If you are a crazy U of I fan then you have to have the clothes to go with the attitude, yes?\n\nThis is not the cheapest place to get your orange and blue on but they do have quality merchandise and a bit different variety than you see at other bookstores.  (They also, curiously enough have books here!  For classes!  What?)\n\nThe Illini fan to whom I am married is 6'6\"" so it is hard to find Illini gear for him but they at least have an extended size rack here so he has managed to score a few items over the years.  They also have such cute baby clothes and as my eldest daughter is due in December, let's just say I may have gone a little crazy here last Saturday.\n\nIf you come here to buy your Illini wear, you might want to hit their special sales on Mom's Weekend, homecoming, stuff like that.  Now I didn't do that this last time but I have in the past.\n\nOskee Wow Wow, get your orange and blue here!	1
The experience with Dollheads was fantastic-had them come to our room to do my daughters hair and makeup and they (Cricelda and Mariana) were on-time, friendly and professional. They did an outstanding job! Will definitely be a returning customer. Oh, and whomever answers their phone is soooooo friendly, too-Rafael, I think is his name. A great experience from start to finish. They always kept in contact with me and were a breeze to work with....	1
Finally found my stylist! I just migrated from the Philippines and after 4 trial cut from different stylist I found Ken the great :) he got the cut the I wss looking for and I end up coloring my hair too! Love it love it love it!!!	1
\""Children and pet friendly while outlet shop\""\n\nDecent outlet. Selection not as good as Cabazon, but not bad either. Surprisingly very Dog friendly with plastic baggies and dog fountain. Very children friendly with water fountain and train rides.	1
[MY BACKGROUND]: I've been coming to Vegas since 1994, and tried pretty much every buffet on the Vegas strip. \n\n[DATE VISITED]: Saturday, March 16th, 2013, Dinner Buffet. Entered the line at 5:10PM, paid at 6:00PM, started eating at 6:40PM. \n\n[THE INTERIOR]: Before you enter the buffet, you will see a huge line, that will remind you of Disneyland. Once you enter the buffet, its major chaos..Chaos!! There are way too many people, and most of the tables seemed very close together. The noise level is really loud. I definitely will not bring my older relatives here, as they might find it too hectic. It seems like the people at Caesar's had a very obscure shaped room to fit in a buffet of this size. \n\n[THE FOOD]: Besides long lines, and chaotic atmosphere, the food here is really really good. The Asian section is probably one of the most authentic tasting Asian section at any Las Vegas buffet. This also goes for the rest of the buffet. The cocktail shrimps they serve are also one of the largest sized cocktail shrimp of any Vegas buffet I've tried.  My sister and I stood in line for the steamed crabs for at least 20 minutes. Determined that we were not going to wait in this line again, we practically filled mountain high 2 plates each (4 plates total), with a layer of cocktail shrimp, and a  huge pile of king crabs on top (we had 4 plates of these). Needless to say, we were a little carried away with how much we brought for my family of 4, but I think we pretty much were satisfied with how much shrimp and crab we ate, that it justified the $50 dinner cost. Also their dessert section is amazing. They also have different flavored mochi and gelato.\n\n[THE SERVICE]: Our server was amazing, in terms of getting our drinks, and cleaning our finished plates. No complaints at all here.  \n\n[THE GOOD]: \n- some of the best tasting buffet food hands down\n- the selection and variety is amazing, \n- the presentation of the foods in the small plates is very nice\n\n[THE BAD]\n- long Lines to get into the buffet, \n- more lines in the buffet to get the food\n- chaotic atmosphere\n- noise level is high, definitely not a place for a romantic dinner\n- One design flaw of the buffet is the line for the steamed crabs. The people that stood in line for the steamed crabs blocked off the whole seafood section. So for the people that did not want steamed crabs, but lets say want a piece of salmon in the seafood section, you couldn't because the people in line for the steamed crabs stood right in front of the food. I guess you could try to sneak in between people in the steamed crab line to get some food, but everybody in line for the steamed crabs had the \""I'm waiting in line, you should too\"" face.  This design flaw also applies to the meat carving section. The line for the meat carving section blocked off another section of the buffet, hence other people couldn't get to those foods either. At one point the line for the steamed crabs and meat carving section blended together, to form one mega line, that caused a lot of confusion. The issue is, they steam the crabs a little at a time, so the line went really really sloowwww. The line wasn't moving at multiple points. We waited at least 20 minutes to get the steamed crabs. They really should place a line divider for the people in these lines so they don't block half of the buffet. \n\n[OVERALL EXPERIENCE]: I've always wanted to try the Bacchanal buffet ever since it opened. We asked the waiter if its always like this, but they said its less crowded on the weekdays, and at earlier times. If I go again next time, I'm going to go at 3:30 PM, and try to avoid the 6 PM dinner crowd.	1
As a 2nd generation Italian, you know you're stepping in an authentic Italian caffe when it's 7:30 AM and 15 elderly Italians are sharing the place with you speaking to one another in different dialects of Italian with plenty of hand gestures to go around about \""La Seria A\"" (it was Monday).\n\nI ordered a cappuccino to go and was immediately received in a very friendly fashion despite on how busy it was. The quality of my cappuccino was exceptional and served quickly.\n\nThe price tag is a bit higher than some other places I know (with an extra fee of ordering to go?) but you'll pay for it and accept it. There's no denying the quality of this place and you pay more for quality.\n\nLa qualita e la.\n\nWill visit again.	1
Awesome.\n\nCirque de Soleil meets MXC\n\nPS: Cute Japanese girls in spandex doing acrobatics. If you are Master Roshi or white dude w/asian fetish, bring toilet paper. Because you will definitely nosebleed.	1
I like this exercise venue so much more than the place that used to collect my fat tax (a.k.a. membership fees). I'm slightly younger than average member, but I find that as a bonus inspiration. If the lady next to me can keep pace on the treadmill while sharing tales about the grandkids, I can power through the lingering remnants of those occasional college cigarettes and inactivity. The RMC is not open on Sundays, which supports my ideas of having a day off, or a cheat day. Good for classes, nice equipment and a rock climbing wall to boot. Can't beat it for the price.	1
This is a refeshingly cute little place in Edinburgh! It looks delicious from the outside, the bright red paint always glistens and looks really glossy - good enough to eat! And their displays are amazing!! At Halloween I spend about 20minutes looking at everything in their window, because there was so much to take in! It was closed at the time, otherwise I would have been in there in a shot. \nSo when I did go in I was amazed at what they had! Blast from the past or what, I was taking a trip down memory lane as I was browsing all the candy they have in here.\nThe staff are lovely too, really professional and they enjoy their job, you can tell. It makes all the difference!\nIt's relatively cheap too, compared to the other similar places.\nThe only thing I didn't like was the smell...it was sickly sweet and made me feel a bit queasy!	1
Great beer, nice atmosphere and a very informative staff.\n\nA brief chat with any of their staff will quickly inform you that this is a brewery were they brew German ales and lagers in a traditional German method, so there won't really be much 'experimenting' as some of the reviewers are complaining about. But what Mecklenburg does is make a very good beer in a city with almost no independent breweries.	1
Today is (or should I say, was) the first day of my \""no eating cupcakes\"" diet. \nHowever, the lure of \""salted caramel\"" cupcakes was too much to bear, and I ended up trying TopIt Cupcakes.\nThe storefront is really cute, and clean, and the people that work there are very nice!\nThere is a little area on the wall where you can \""top it\"" if you want to add to your cupcake toppings, as well ( I've never seen that before, but it's a great idea).\nNow, for the sugary details. \nI only ordered 2 cupcakes today (down from the normal 6, but I cannot continue to eat like this and fit in my skinny jeans!). Although I have never had a good peanut butter cupcake (usually too greasy) I ordered a peanut butter and jelly cupcake, and of course, salted caramel.\nBoth of the cupcakes were good in flavor, but the salted caramel could've used more sea salt (just a tad more, mind you). \nThe peanut butter and jelly (finally!) was my fave of the day. It was a white cupcake filled with grape jelly with peanut butter frosting (and, a little cookie on top). FINALLY, a cupcake store that got peanut butter right!\nHere's the negative on TopIt: Compared to Caketini (the best I've tasted so far) the cupcakes both were a little on the no-so-fresh-in-texture side. Not that the cupcakes were dry, but the tops were a little \""crusty\"". I know...picky,picky, picky...\nI get that they don't use preservatives, and I am happy for that, but just a tad more on the fresh side would've snagged me for life...or the life of my skinny jeans...\nAlso, these cupcakes are \""normal\"" size, which I personally like better than the biggies at some of the other cupcake stores...\nStill, this place has a lot to offer in the cupcake world, and I'll definitely be back on Fridays for Cotton Candy, Malted Milk Ball and whatever I can stuff in my ever-growing tummy.	1
Vraiment de tr\u00e8s bons Sushi!!! Les pizzas Sushi sont un d\u00e9lice!! \u00c7a ne se compare vraiment pas aux autres cha\u00eenes de restaurant a de Sushi!! Livraison rapide!! Et bon prix !!	1
Hugo was great, He has been there for 11 years and he knows how to cut hair, old school.  I felt he did a great job at all the classic details right down to the hot lather shave of the back of my neck and sideburns for a really crisp edge.  He made sure my brows were not bushy and that no stray hairs were growing out of my ears.  I have not had such a professional and enjoyable haircut in years and wanted to share the experience. While I was there a steady flow of people came in, The other Barber while I didn't catch his name seemed equally professional.  This is a Barbershop the old fashion way, a place for all kind of guys to get the haircut they are looking for	1
So happy we don't have to drive to Anstruther to get great fish and chips any more! light flaky batter - chips that are crispy on the outside and soft inside - my perfect Fish and Chips. I've taken away and sat in the restaurant - both great. \n\nIf you go for take away - be prepared to wait.  they fry the fish and chips to order - nothing is sitting around!!	1
Decent tasting. Super cheap for the strip. Super duper cheap compared to the other offerings in the same food court. Not super authentic, but what do you expect from a Chinese take-out place in the middle of Las Vegas?	1
good sandwiches. the gread is always soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. haven't tried anything else here though. they have pho and other stuff.	1
Just paid another visit to this brewery and I have to say it was a good one they have improved greatly in a few months (maybe trying to live up to their award for best new brewery) \n\nThe first time i visited the beers were just ok, too hoppy and kind of generic for my taste and the only good one was the Sour Wheat beer (unique, refreshing and very light alcohol). I liked the chill kinda vibe and the outdoor theme. Gotta love the bearded brewers :-)\n\nThis round i tried the coffee stout, the Sour wheat (called BWBW i believe) and  Dark ale. Seems they always have 6 on tap the others were IPA style so not for me. The coffee stout is one of the best i have ever had, so smooth and creamy and great flavor, it does have coffee in it so i should only try these earlier in the day :-). The others we very tasty as well and have now changed my opinion on this place (before it was barely a 3 star).\n\nI tried the rosemary fries cooked in duck fat and they were yummy, still need to go back and try the food.\n\nIt was busy around happy hour but manageable (early in the week anyways) and our server was good and knowledgeable.	1
Tried this place out after I saw they won the Arizona taco festival in a number of categories. After trying it myself I certainly can tell why. Their tacos have super thin tortillas that provides a flavor explosion in your mouth. The carne asada is different than a traditional carne taco but it has to be one of my favorite menu items. Everything I have tried has been good. The atmosphere is great too. I am pleasantly surprised this place is still on local dines, it's a great deal.	1
I have been here plenty of times and the food is always great and service is spot on! They will accommodate special requests with no problem!\nI love the Tom Yum soup, and they were kind enough to make it vegetarian and add noodles!\nAlso the green curry and red curry are favorites, along with the coconut mango sticky rice for dessert!	1
I just had the best interview with Ms Townsend.  Not only was she kind, she was just brilliant in the analysis of my employment issue. Even though I was calling for a friend, and from out of state, she took the time to direct me (and my friend) to another attorney who could best serve our needs.	1
Following recommendations I made a reservation and was glad I did.  Business was brisk on a Thursday night.    I arrived at 5:40 for a 6:00 o'clock reservation, and found a parking spot right in front of the door.  This was a sign that it was going to be a good night.  It was half price Sake night - a carafe of Fuji Apple Sake was a great starter while I awaited my friends.  We were seated promptly when everyone arrived.  Our waiter was very knowledgable and helpful explaining the extensive menu.  One guest and I decided to split the Caribbean Summer Rolls, and I am glad we did, otherwise I would not have been able to eat my dinner.  I chose Filet Oscar Roll from the Burgushi menu, while another diner chose the South of the Border Roll, the third party in our group went for the Moriawase dozen and was glad she followed the waiters recommendation to start off with the dozen and if she wanted more he could increase it to the double deuce.   Everyone enjoyed the food.  Desserts were ordered to go.   My apple pie wontons were alright, but probably would have been better if I weren't so full and could have eaten them there while they were warm.  A nice touch was the owner coming around to ask us about our dining experience and to hand out cards for a free appetizer which are good until the end of 2011.   I like the burgushi concept.  Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar is definitely on my list of favorites and places I would go on a date or take an out of town guest.	1
The pizza here is really good !! I always go with friends cause its an awesome place. The only thing I think its wrong is the establishment charging for Ranch... But besides that I super recommend this place its good and not too pricy.	1
I've been on Duck tours in Boston, Philly, DC, and Seattle - but the Pittsburgh Just Ducky Tour was by far the best!  Colton was our guide and was very good. The tour goes through downtown and through a beautiful section of the river. This is a must do if you visit Pittsburgh.	1
I have to come to understand and accept that I am probably the reason restaurateurs  hate yelpers.\n\nI just have no appreciation for atmosphere. I know this because during my 12-day stay in the Bay area, the word had to be repeatedly hammered into my brain, as the natives could not understand how I could merely judge a restaurant's merit based solely on their cuisine. \n\nEventually they wrote me off as a lost cause, chalking up my dis-appreciation of fine decor and tacky acoustic music as a symptom of being Phoenician. \n\nFor a while I was confused. I didn't know what was wrong with me. Was I just impossible to please? Had I no taste for aesthetics? Oh shit, I have no aesthetic sensibility. I'm an art major. What does that mean for me?\n\nAll I have is a clock radio. Who am I Mommy?\n\nI was beginning to have some serious doubts about my aptitude for critique. \n\nSweet Zombie Jesus. Maybe I didn't know what I was talking about all this time.\n\nAfter all, Angie and Jimmie's is as far from atmosphere as you could be. Like, as far as John Cage is from actual music, or Miley Cyrus from being talented. \n\nFun Fact: While in San Carlos we saw a guy parked underneath a Miley Cyrus billboard giving himself some of the old \""self-service at the pump\"". True story.\n\nThere are no polished tables and cushy chairs at A&J's. No, instead they have those all-plastic all-purpose chairs that last you years and years sitting in your backyard until you invite that one plus-sized friend of yours who sits in it and bends it in such a way that is is never usable again. \n\nAnd there is no ambient music. Only the sounds of the arcade machines and the TV, which no matter what time of day is always playing a crime drama. Or a Billy Mays infomercial.\n\n \""HI BILLY MAYS HERE BUY SOME FUCKING OXI-CLEAN OR I'LL SHOVE SOME MIGHTY PUTTY UP YOUR ASS WHILE I BANG YOUR WIFE!\""\n\nThe staff at A&J care as much about presentation as Fred Phelps does about receiving a box set of \""The L Word\"" for Christmas.\n\nTheir wings are not soaked in the sauce (BBW calls the process \""spinning\"") like at other joints. No, the wings are cooked, and then, the sauce is poured over them. At first you're like \""this is fucking shady, I am not pleased with this\"", but when you can actually taste the chicken, and dont' have to ask for like fifty extra napkins, you find you might actually walk away from the table with some dignity. \n\nTry saying the same thing after paying 9 bucks for half a sandwich while ten pounds of bitch in a five pound bag asks you if you have room for dessert.\n\nThe subs are meaty and quite sustaining. So I've heard. I have a rule about ordering shit that isn't on the sign. I've never ordered a cheeseburger at Del Taco or chicken nuggets at a Red Lobster, and here I am, still alive and kicking. The system works.\n\nThe pizza is simply fucking fabulous. It's crispy but never crunchy, hot but never molten, and cheesy but never \""hey, how long are you going to be on the toilet? I need to take a shower\"" cheesy. Honestly, the only pizza I've had in Phoenix that even compares to it is Pizza A Metro...which is another small independently owned pizza shop crammed next to a Circle K...\n\n...\n\nMaybe it isn't me. Maybe it's just Phoenix. Or just the west side of it. Everything's backwards here. It's like Bizarro world.\n\nAll the best food is located in these hole-in-the-walls, where the decor is haphazard the menus have to be laminated because people are always spilling shit on them. \n\nThere's still a pretty good chance that I'm a tasteless Philistine, but we're  in Bizarro World and that makes me a learned connoisseur of wealth and taste. \n\nI fucking love it here.	1
I had a fantastic time at the Trump Hotel with my Girlfriend Lily. We started by having breakfast with my family, going to F21 (the largest one ever), throwing on our new dresses, buying nail polish at the spa, hanging out by the pool, then making lasagna in my room.\n\nI enjoyed staying at the Trump. The room is beautiful and located across from the giant Fashion Show Mall, all valet hotel, the service was a little slow. I think they were a bit understaffed, with that said, the staff was always friendly. We had an issue with the movie channels and engineering came up and fixed it right away. Housekeeping was also on hand with I was cooking the lasagnas. We did have to call them three times to come up, again, I think that is a staffing issue.\n\nTip: Since this is an all valet hotel call valet prior to going downstairs so that they can bring your car up. Also, strip facing views are amazing... we stayed in Penthouse 6000. It is not a casino so keep that in mind if you plan on booking and I didn't think the restaurant there was that great either. So, I guess what I am saying is I loved the view, the location, and the gorgeous room with full kitchen for my lasagna making...pictures on my blog	1
I use to eat here up to 3 times a week when I first head of this place. It's close enough that it delivers to my job and in the same plaza as my hair salon so it was a must every time I was nearby. A little overpriced for the kind of food that it is but it sooo delicious.\n\nmy favorites are the fried crab rice, the yellow curry, their eggrolls, and their Thai tea.\n\nvery quick delivery	1
I rarely write reviews on yelp but after my fourth visit to Southwest Bimmers, I had to show some love. By far the best place to bring your BMW in the Las Vegas area. Extremely easy to make an appointment, very knowledgable staff, and they give you options which most places don't do. Most shops I have been to will just say this is what you need done and that's that. Southwest Bimmer will give you a couple options and works with you to get the lowest price. I wouldn't say they are the cheapest in town, but I would rather pay a couple extra bucks to get the better service. Plus if you have a bimmer you should be able to afford better service. It is far cheaper than going to a BMW dealership and they have just as good if not better technicians. \n100% recommend them.	1
Perfect spot on the strip!\n\nJust to reiterate what's already been said.....\n\n*YES, it's a timeshare; therefore don't expect daily room service (just call when you need a cleaning)\n*YES; there's no casino; BUT you're connected to the Cosmo and a 5min walk to Bellagio\n\nBONUS it's like a mini apartment, you can save and re-heat your leftover food. Chill your drinks and all that other good stuff you do at home except smoke, there is absolutely NO SMOKING, they will charge you!	1
This location has the best staff, they're friendly and inviting. I come here often and they remember my order which is a huge plus. Dutchbros espresso is awesome, it'll really wake you up, unlike starbucks.\n\nAnother big plus is when the drive thru line is packed someone will come out and take your order so by the time you get to the window your drink is ready!	1
Really nice guy, great communication- and very important to me- he does what he says he's going to do!	1
My family hosted the First Annual Eddie Martinez Cinco de Mayo at the River Bottom Grill on 5/4/13 and it was awesome!!! River Bottom went above and beyond to help make this a successful fundraising event! The food and drinks were great and the space was perfect for the event.  There was a bounce house and water slide for the kids along with facepainting, sno cones, silent auction, cake auction, etc.  It was amazing to see the town of Florence come together to support my cousin's husband, Eddie in his battle against cancer.  My husband and I will definitely be back and look forward to next year's event!	1
The food here is amazing, the owner Amer is very friendly and eager to please, all his customers. The staff is very nice as well. It is very clean and the bathrooms are too. This is a family owned and operated business which is nice to see, and they are opening a second location in Henderson.	1
My friends and I finished up our beer tour here two weekends ago! NoDa was the place to be, and everyone knew it. We enjoyed a tour of the brewery. The guide was informative, funny, and corny in the right places. After the tour, we sat outside for a long while and just relaxed. The atmosphere was amazing, and you can tell they take pride in their brewery. There was also a food truck outside, which had good fries and fried clams. My husband absolutely loves NoDa's beer, especially Hop, Drop, and Roll, so I know we'll be back! :)	1
Pretty decent place.  Really nice food (though a bit more expensive than a lot of comparable places).  Only real gripe is if I recall correctly everything is ala carte (pancakes were by themselves, meat was a separate side) which while opening up the number of potential combinations, it hikes the price a bit.  I have seen a few reviews that dinged the service, however we went to a later breakfast (about 10AM) on a weekday and had no issues at all.	1
The food is really good here.  I can sense that the owner really cares about the quality of the food. It's the only place so far that has my favorite dessert, Sweet sticky rice with durian.  Other restaurant won't serve it bc of their infamous fragrance...oh well.  All I can say to my fellow Thai food eaters is this...PLEASE DO NOT SMELL THE FOOD, JUST PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH AND SAVOR THE FLAVOR.  I found that sometimes food that smells good, does not necessary taste good.  In our culture, THE STINKIER, THE BETTER!!!	1
While visiting Phoenix I turned to Yelp to find something new and cool to do and once again, my fellow Yelpers steered me in the right direction! I decided to check out the Mesa Thrift Store based on the great reviews here and I didn't leave disappointed! \n\nSimply put, this is a great thrift store. It's very small but the goodies inside are top-notch. Maybe I'm used to the not-so-great thrift stores here in Las Vegas (the aisles at Goodwill are crammed with free casino t-shirts and other junk), but this place has oodles of treasures if you are willing to look. The racks aren't overly crammed full, making it easy to browse and the shelves were fairly well organized. The store was clean (as far as thrift shops go) and the employees were friendly. Lots and lots of Spanish speaking shoppers. The parking lot out front is very small and was crowded when I went; you might have to circle to get a spot.\n\nI didn't find a lot of great vintage finds here (the clothing is mostly newer styles and discount brands like you'd find at Kohls or the Gap), but there were some decent vinyl records and books. The electronics had seen better days so buyer beware. A few of the vintage bicycles out front caught my eye too. If you are a hipster, there were tons of ironic t-shirts for 99 cents each. (AS IF an actual hipster would ever admit to being one, *insert sarcastic eye roll here*).\n\nMost of the items were in very good to excellent condition and the prices were reasonable and fair. I left with a vintage real Denver Broncos NFL jersey ($4.99), two brand new full size Yankee Candles ($6.99 each), and a new looking Robert Graham polo shirt ($9.99). Definitely worth checking out if you are in the Phoenix area or if you love bargain hunting.	1
Was here on 9/26 Saturday night. \n\nI'm not one for waiting in lines. I hate them in fact. Decided to come to this place to kill sometime while some other places' lines died down. \n\nWe ended up staying the whole night. No line and was a smaller more intimate establishment. The DJ was good enough and cocktails were $10 a piece. Not too bad.\n\nGood mix of crowd young and old and of course you have your mix of crazies who think they're still in their 20's. Entertainment can't get better than that.\n\nAfter a long night out its definitely nice to just leave and take the elevator up to your room to crash. Don't know if I could have made it any further than that.\n\nThis place did the job!	1
This place has the best prices around. I drive from scottsdale just to go here. They have a great selection of tobacco, hookah, and glass products. In addition they have some odd stuff I've never seen before like \""shrooms\"" for tea. And yes I was told they are the psychedelic kind. They also have a punch card where you get a discount after 10 visits. The staff is friendly and helpful and its never to busy so you can get in and out quick. This is my preferred smoke shop in an area that has an abundance of them.	1
Capo's Is A Real Kick.  The concept and atmosphere are great.  We were there on a Sunday and they had a Frank Sinatra era singer doing classics.  The music was a bit too loud but that was part of the fun- it was not so loud we couldn't hear each other. The food was good- all 4 in our party were pleased- and better then expected.  Those of us who ordered chicken entrees the portions were perfect.  Those who ordered pasta needed take home boxes.  A bit over the top for an every night stop- but a great choice for a fun special night out.	1
4 1/2 Stars\n\nCame here on a Friday night with 2 other people and wait was about a good 20-30 minutes.  We hung out at the bar.  They have refreshing mojitos.\n\nThe dishes themselves are fairly inexpensive, but they quickly add up.  It was a bit crowded but overall good service and even better food.\n\nI was weary about the food/restaurant since I hadn't had tapas before but was quickly impressed.  \n\nMust Try:\n-Mussels\n-Meatballs\n-Mac and Cheese\n-Croquettes\n-Ribs	1
First time at Texas de Brazil and I was so surprised at how overwhelming it can be.  Nick finally had to remind me to turn my card over (I forgot).  The salad bar is the best I've seen - so many selections and when I saw proscuitto, that was it for me.\n\nSurprisingly (or maybe not so surprising), the flank steak was my favorite.  I forget how good flank steak it, it just needs some TLC to bring out the best it has to offer.  Tender, juicy, and very flavorful!  I enjoyed the mashed potatoes as well - fluffy and salted (maybe a just a bit too much salt).\n\nOne hitch - the wine that was brought out was the wrong vintage; it was two years younger.  We tried it anyways, and it was ok.  I don't know if there was a price difference, and nothing was offered.  Not a big enough deal to fret over it, but something to be aware of.	1
Okay, first off, I'm one of those people that come here strictly for food and not beer.  Don't judge me.\n\nI've frequent this certain location off-and-on ever since Westgate opened.  The location is ideal --- far away from the bars, stores, and movie theater yet close enough for a short walk.  Parking here is always plentiful.  From all the times I've been here, I would say they're the busiest during dinner.  If you're lucky enough to be here at certain times, take advantage of their Happy Hour and reverse Happy Hour.  Food is generally cheaper and you get plenty of food.  I recommend the Slider Combo~\n\nMy favorite things served here:  Garlic fries, lobster bisque, and the ribeye with gorgonzola butter.  Yum!	1
This place is great! Let's start with the food.. I began with the springrolls which were awesome. The marinated beef added in is a great touch. I then had the chicken soup, the broth was bursting with flavors. Just enough cilantro and green onion. The pho here is what I have been looking for around ASU. \nDon't forget about the employees! Great people with in hearts.. with great food ad welcoming staff I want to run back right now! Thanks for making my first visit enjoyable, I will be back soon!	1
AMAZING!!! My friend and I loved Britney! We sang and danced the entire time.  The dancers were awesome! Definitely a must see and I wouldn't mind going to see her again.	1
This quaint little spot def isn't as cheap as the reviews would lead you on to believe. $10.95 for a gyro isn't what I would consider cheap combo, but it was for the quality of food you receive! The lady friend and I enjoyed the food while watching Monday night football was more than cute and enjoyable...plus the owners throw in of an on the spot desert more than has me wanting to come back to this place! Oh yeah...def try the fries!	1
Anthony is an incredible hair stylist and has exceptional customer service skills! I just moved to Arizona and was nervous to find a new stylist but he was the best find. He is patient and open to your ideas but will be honest with his expertise. So glad I found him!	1
We decided to try this vegetarian Chinese restaurant that opened this past April for lunch immediately prior to flying home.  We parked behind the restaurant on the 2nd level of the plaza and entered through the rear door.  The restaurant is bright, meticulously clean and tastefully decorated.  We were immediately greeted at the door and seated by Mimi who was incredibly cheerful and informative as were both chef/owner Kenny and another server who I believe may have been his wife.  The meal started with complimentary cups of soup - a clear broth with a few vegetables and tofu.  For entrees, we shared the crispy spicy eggplant and spicy crispy beef. Both were delicious, but the \""beef\"" dish, made from tofu, was interesting due to its crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, texture and flavor.	1
Shared the tasting menu which was a lot of food, and all of it great, although expensive.  If you're looking for authentic Japanese fare, this isn't the place for you.  But the flavor combinations worked if you're up for some experimenting.  Place was fun and festive and our well-behaved, Japanese food-loving kids (6 & 9) enjoyed it too.  Went at 6:30p which was perfect because it was busy but not full.  Service was very attentive even if his pronunciation of the Japanese menu was off.	1
Accessory mavens, prepare to lose self control. This store has TONS of merchandise organized into color coded sections. Handy because you could definitely get overwhelmed in this feast of fashion. Talk about somewhere that you wouldn't want to do inventory...yikes.\n\nEvery time I visit I find something I \""need\"". I can't think of a better place to visit if you're looking for that one item to complete an ensemble. Scarves, purses, necklaces, earrings and even a new addition of slippers can be found in ever color section. They even have dresses, shirts and footwear if you're really starting an outfit from scratch. \n\nThe staff is attentive and pleasant and they're happy to explain the layout of the store for newbies. There is a kids section in the back as well as a clearance section. Enter your name in the customer database and never have to worry about tracking down a receipt again. \n\nJust love this place, it motivates me to make the drive over to Tivoli Village.	1
Great customer service, beautiful hotel design, great location on the strip.  The rooms are a little smaller than I care for, but I have stayed here a number of times regardless.  I usually stay at the Palazzo properties, but this would be my next choice if I could not...\n\nIf you can swing upgrading to a room facing the fountains it's always fun to watch the show.	1
First discovered Crystal when visiting the city for a conference. Walked by the window and saw a picture of the guy from Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and I knew I had to have some of that. \n\nIt took little convincing to get my co worker to walk back to the strip to try it out. \n\nGlad we did. Kitchy atmospher, wonderful service and a great Med. menu.\n\nMost recent visit was three days ago. Had the lamb screws and hummas. Wonderful and great chatting with the staff.\n\nOpens at 5 so plan to hit the Stip and wind down at Crystal	1
It has come to my attention that I have not reviewed Rokerij. Clearly this is a travesty of justice so I'm here to make things right in the world. I've been to Rokerij twice now and both times left fat and happy. and buzzed. \n\nI dined at Rokerij on Sunday evening; it was a \""Saves the Day\"" moment because the first choice restaurant fell through and Dottsy was starving and reaching for my throat. We booked it to Rokerij and sat at the sexy copper bar, ready to partake in some small plate action. As everyone has mentioned, the happy hour deals are for the bar only, between 4-6PM. They are running a new wine promotion too: Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, all bottles are 50% off. Yay! I ordered all the seafood plates: mushrooms stuffed with crab, ceviche, ahi tuna w/ wasabi, and crab tostadas. With the Long Boat Sauvignon Blanc in hand I was in heaven. \n\nI like that the bar is dark and cozy, though I noticed a light was actually out above me, making it near impossible to see my menu. The Happy Hour deal rocks, but it does make me sad not to be able to sit in those comfy leather chairs by the fire sipping wine and stuffing my face on ultra-cheap eats. \n\nRokerij is a solid performer, and probably deserves that 5th star, but I'm holding off until I finally dine in the main restaurant and enjoy one of their delicious sounding entrees.	1
I love this place! the staff are so helpful and with the beg pottery wheel class I got to make 3 bowls with the wheel and glaze them all. Super fun and Im going back in 2 weeks to try the dirty hands class...	1
Gorgeous! Service was amazing. Courteous staff.  Beautiful suite we had. \n\nRoom issues: my card sometimes wouldn't work right away. Shower had dark mildew stains. Toilet flushed when it wanted to. Maybe we had a ghost.! \nThe suite was huge, beautifully decorated. Overall appeared clean.\nThe bed...oh the bed, 100% egyptian cotton soft sheets. No pilling on the sheets, they seemed clean, but it is a hotel. Cute little chocolate for the turndown service. Fluffy pillows. Huge bathroom, double sink, vanity area separate shower from the tub. I love all the space! Enough room for three naked fake boob girls to walk around my stuff.\n\nMany places to gamble, eat and shop shop shop!	1
BOMBDOTCOM. Enough said.\n\nLocated on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, in front of the Marquee exit. My first bite of their white pizza was just... *BOOOOOM*. Unexplainable, chees-y, garlic-y goodness. The entrance, without any discernable signs, \""could\"" be mistaken for a line to a bathroom. But you cant really miss the club-goers carrying out their whole pie or eating a slice as they lounge on the sofas. I mean.. come on. Hence, the lines/wait can get a bit long. \n\nEver since my first experience, I cannot call it a night out in Vegas until I've had my Secret Pizza Fix.  I can hit up a club on the other freaking side of the strip and still take a taxi to the Cosmo to get a slice. It is safe to say I am HOOKED and hands-down my favorite pizza place in Vegas, or even LA for that matter. (suggestions for great neapolitan pizzas in the greater LA area are welcome!!!!)\n\nFYI.. the other pizzas (cheese, pepperoni, etc.) are fine.. its just you will wish you had like.. 3 slices of the white pizza IMHO. \nThe Salad is pretty good too so.. if there are any vegetarians/someone on a diet in the group.. well there you go.\nand OMFG WTF I cannot believe I forgot about the peppers. They have the best pickled peppers so you must ask them for some.. a little bit sweet, a little bit spicy, omy~ YUMMMMMMM\n\nI cannot wait to go back to Vegas!! Good thing there are a ton of Bachelorette parties coming up. :)	1
Had a bachelorette dinner here with 22 girls. Our table was ready within 10-15 minutes of arrival with a nice view of the cooking station. We had a set menu that had the bachelorettes name along the top. The food and presentation was excellent; however, the only presentation I did not particularly like was the croquettes that came out in paper in a tennis shoe. Even though I know the shoe was clean, it still grossed me out a bit. Tennis shoes shouldn't be on a table. Period.  It did take a little while between some of the tapas to come out. I was starving. Everything had great flavor!  The sparking mojito...mmmm!\n\nFor me, everything tasted wonderful!	1
Getting started with lunch buffet. Fill your plate and pay by weight. Salad and dressing were gluten free. Sausage \""from Chicago\"" did not seem to have fillers. Good place to get your Scandinavian food fix with a Polish twist.  Self serve, Very casual at lunch time.	1
Finally, a feminist, body positive sex shop that doesn't make you feel like crap. You can tell that the staff is very passionate about what they do and the store is designed to make your visit as comfortable as possible. It is a bit pricy, but there is a huge and thorough selection with lots and lots of information about the products. There are also complimentary informational brochures about topics on sexual health, practices, and exploration. I feel like this is a much needed business in Madison and in the world!	1
Great food and gotta give a shout out to Gem for amazing service, Kalbi burger was phenomenal and so was the Apple Lychee soda.	1
Great store with great pricing. Just about everything you would want. Sometimes its a bit difficult to find a matching pair but for the most part, good service and very easy to find what you are looking for. Found pet items, bath towels and wine glasses.	1
I come here a few times a week for the chips and salsa and shrimp tacos.. The horchata is the BEST in the area...they have fresh limeade and pineapple juice that they make daily..\n\nI recommend any chicken dish since they spice it so good... The taquitos are a great value and a meal in itself $3.99.. Now fir the best shrimp tacos in the world... The shrimp are seasoned and grilled ( not fried), juicy and it cones with a big slice of avocado and fresh pico on the taco.. I could eat 6 of these and still want more.\n\nThis is a small family owned joint and the owners are friendly and keep the place really clean. I just can't say enough about this place... I LOVE it... It's like going to an old friends house and being treated with TLC... Oh and the police like to eat here too, so I feel pretty safe	1
One of the best Happy Hours in Las Vegas.  Well drinks, house wines, and domestic beers as well as a specialized tapas menu are 50% off 4PM - 7PM every day.  Even Friday and Saturday.  Not bad.  \n\nA few standout Tapas pieces I had were the Mac N' Cheese, the pork empanada, as well as the chicken and mushroom soup.  All very tasty.\n\nDrinks are of a good size, but if you want a drink I'd suggest the wine or get a beer, as I believe they are watering their well drinks during happy hour. \n\nRegardless, I've had good service on the two occasions I have been here, and quite tasty food.	1
Food is delicious! And the service is AWESOME!  We thought we'd never get a table....Friday night, the parking lot was packed, but we got right in and chips were on the table immediately! The cups were never empty and the chips were always full! Hard to find service that good!!	1
