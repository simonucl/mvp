My friends wanted to eat here for dinner. If I'd known what kind of restaurant it was, I wouldn't have come with them. The entire concept of backwoods decor + people being assholes, not a huge fan. Also, the food is average and overpriced. This is a place to come to when you're already drunk, that way your standards are much lower for food and respect.	0
The food was awful, the mashed potatoes were cold, the roast beef was cold even though it was carved on the spot, very few choices and for a dinner buffet i expected way more than the bland tasteless food served here.\n\nI will never recommend this buffet to anyone! Good thing I got it for free!	0
This is where Derek Zoolander eats. \n\nCame after watching \""O\"" and the music was bumping and the lights were dimmed.  Young hotties eating at each table, I definitely felt out of place...especially when the hostess gave my outfit the once over and let me stand at the counter for 10 minutes before telling me she was looking for a table for me.\n\nOnce sat, our server was really friendly but definitely looked stressed.  I don't know why, but I felt that every server/busboy looked like they were rushing around.  Too many tables for each of them?  \n\nWe settled for the kobe sliders, cold seafood appetizer, and lobster tacos for our \""meal\"".   BTW it took them 10 minutes to get back to us to take our order after we told them we were ready. \n\nThe lobster tacos are TINY but very flavorful.  The cold seafood appetizer is tiny as well but very fresh.  The kobe slider are delicious...but I love any burger.  Too bad they cooked it well done when I asked for medium rare. \n\nAfter you order, a busboy is pretty quick at taking away your plates and refilling your water but our server constantly looked busy.  \n\nOverall the food is MEH and after spending over $100 bucks at this place I felt like I stepped into an overpriced, loud, snobby nightmare.	0
OVERPRICED & OVERRATED food & service is absolutely HORRIBLE..I give it 1 star due to the decor..they sell you the buffet by making it look soo nice on the outside..the food is overheated/ undercooked & all the food that does look decent to eat, they don't put that much out there so then people take it all & then you have to wait until they make it again & bring it out 4 u..SUCKS..YUCK.. BLAH...not WORTH your time/ MONEY.. =/ I would definitely NOT come back...\n\nEven the Rio & the Paris Buffet beats this place! =/	0
DO NOT GO HERE!!!!\n\nAS always I should have listened to you Yelpers. I tried, I really did but the rest of the party I was with insisted they wanted to go here even though the restaurant next door was Moroccan and had belly dancers! ( not to mention 4 stars). Just as other people have commented, Yes there is a very annoying Italian manager that just loves to teach you about \""Brazilian steak house\"". I have a feeling he is going deaf, everything coming out of him is very boisterous and he even bends over when you place your order and yells in your ear \""WHAT?\"" The horrible part was there was an actual Brazilian in our group but the manager had no idea... he thought us so many things about \""Brazilian steak house\"" he even taught me how to drink out of a cup.  He was very perturbed when we wanted to see the menu instead of getting the \""Brazilian steak\"", \""YOU DO NOT WANT TO EAT BRAZILIAN FOOD??\"" This is because it is the most expensive thing on the menu.\n\nThe restaurant inside looks like they picked up everything at a garage sale and then put it all together in one big space. There is a huge chandelier in the middle of the restaurant that consists of 40 green desk lamps turned upside down. The restaurant also comes complete with pastel crane \""posters\"" from a 90's hotel.\n\nThe food:\nDISGUSTING.\nI ordered the Greek salad because I was scared to get anything else. They over drenched it with salad dressing and the feta was out of those President packages you get at the supermarket. The Brazilian guy we were with got the actual \""Brazilian Steak\"" which is all you can eat of different cuts of meat. \""NO DOGIE BAGS AND NO SHARING\"" barked the manager. I didn't want to eat any of his stinking meat anyway it looked like it had been recycled from day to day. One of the waiters asked my B.F if he wanted more turkey ( Brazilians don't even eat turkey) and he said \""no\"" he was full and the old geezer got mad and said that he is required to ask and that he should be polite! ok... the B.F puts up with my shit all day long and doesn't say a thing... this guy just wanted to be a dick.\n\nP.S- Even some of the other waiters were making crazy faces(LOCO) behind the managers back  when he was talking to the table!! Everyone thinks he's an idiot, even his employees!!	0
39 days until I get out of this place, and counting.  I was really excited to move in, and the staff was actually pretty nice while I was shown around and signing the lease.  That really changed after I was in.  \nThe management here has turned out to be extremely poor, and unfriendly.  Never a smile or a hello. Anything you ask of them, say a leaking faucet, and they act like they are doing a major favor for you to take care of it.  \n\nPros?  The views are nice - IF they have had the windows cleaned recently, but they are more commonly dirty.  \n\nCons?  Lack of amenities for a place this expensive.  Pool is tiny, and rarely in the sun.  1 barbecue grill that rarely works.  The gym is a joke.  Slow response to any requests to fix issues in the apartment. Unfriendly staff - avoid dealing with the so called \""manager\"", Kevin. Cold showers, or sometimes hot showers - constant problem with controlling the water temperature - that is, when you have water.  It seems they shut the water off every couple of weeks for \""maintenance\"".  Elevator issues at times, with some extremely long wait times to get an elevator. Moving in and out is a huge pain - reserving the tiny freight elevator, if it's available when you need it, then squeezing a moving truck into the narrow, smelly alley behind the building - good luck. \n\nOverall, if you want to move downtown, I highly recommend going somewhere else.  I recently looked at the new City Scape residences.  They look like a much better option, much better amenities, and everyone there is so much friendlier.	0
This is our store and they are usually really good.  But they missed it this morning - Friday before a holidaybweekend and only one register open at 10 am.  Unusually long wait	0
Wow. So they were open on Thanksgiving which was awesome. However, the food was meh. There were a few vege options, the food tasted mediocre. I would not eat here again if my life depended on it. There is so much better (like Sawad). The wall next to our table needed work - the corner was so banged up, the drywall was was coming off. There were mysterious brown stains on the wall next to me, hanging dust lines from the ceiling (have you ever been to First Ave in Minneapolis? Yea, it was like that) and it was just dirty inside. The table cloths under the glass were also stained. Save your money and go elsewhere.	0
Horrible! Waited 15 min  walked into dinning room and only 3 tables had people with 20 empty. Service was bad and super slow messed up order. Food was mediocre burger was good just needed some sort of condiment because dryness. Wings were rough on the pallet stick to original buffalo. After she took all the plates she came back  10 minutes later an asked if we were done. We had to ask for check because apparently it wasn't implied.	0
NOT a fan.  I went here for Blues Jam Night with some out of town friends.  That part of the experience was enjoyable.  My friend is a drummer and had a great time jamming out with the locals.  The mistake we made was ordering food from this establishment.  I am not sure really how this place calls themselves Vietnamese food.  I ordered the stir fried egg noodles with beef, spicy.  I am 100% they stir fried some ramen noodles with frozen peas, etc.  It wasn't spicy at all either.  It was very puzzling.  My friend ordered fried rice and I really think it was the premade frozen fried rice from Trader Joe's.  It had the ambiance of a dive bar and I think they should stick to that genre and lose the \""Vietnamese\"" food.\n\nBottom line: the entertainment was entertaining, but the food was not good!	0
BUG in my food!  WTF!!  \n\nI was here with a friend November 2011.  We were staying at HardRock anyway - so we stopped in here for dinner.  Our food came and we started eating- I WAS EATING when I noticed a weird spot on my rice - then I looked closer and it was some kind of BUG!  It was super small (still a BUG) and had tiny wings.  It was like pale greyish brown.  I was shocked!!  It was freaky, I couldn't figure out what it was!    Inside the panic and adrenaline was running!\n\nI frantically looked around - cant everyone is this restaurant see this?!  It took a few LONG minutes to flag the waitress down - then I showed her.  She looked at me, looked at the food and said very loudly \""SHUT-UP\"" (not rudely - but in an OMG - you have got to be kidding me)  she snatched up the plate and went toward the kitchen.  Im watching her like.. now what?  Finally I got up and went to go find her - where she was still lingering by the kitchen window - and i swear they were all smiling and getting a good chuckle out of this.  I told her we were leaving.  I double checked to make sure it was ok that we didn't have to pay for our meals or drinks - and she shrugged her shoulders and said it was fine.  When there is a living bug on your food - there are hundreds in the kitchen!  ADIOS Pink Taco.	0
I have been to BRGR 4 times.  The food is great and I was always recommending it and preferred it over Burgatory.  Our last visit, however, may be our last visit.  There were 4 of us - 2 of which were newbies and came on our recommendation.  All was good up until the very end.  We had paid our check and were sitting there chatting NO MORE THAN 5 minutes when our server informed us that they needed our table and requested that we leave.  Granted, we were offered a to-go milkshake but, in my opinion, that HARDLY makes up for the embarrassment and humiliation of being asked to leave a restaurant for ANY reason.  I would have certainly understood more if we had been sitting at our table for 20-30 minutes - but 5 minutes?  Really?  We will miss you BRGR - but I simply refuse to be treated that way no matter how busy you are.  And you weren't even all that busy.  Bottom-line - good burgers and food but they are more into turning tables over than making their customers feel valued or caring if they ever return.	0
Remember the saying, \""If it sounds too good to be true, it typical iS?\"" That is EXACTLY right with the IP. I will * N E V E R * stay at this place again, even if it was a \""deal\"" as compared to other hotels.\n\nShuttle service from the airport is at the back end, and have to hike a bit to get into the hotel from the heat (and away from sweaty bodies). Waited in 'the line from hell' for EXACTLY 52 minutes, 18 seconds (yes, I timed it just to see how long it would take when I saw the line). Get this: FIVE check in windows, TWO clerks, and ONE of them kept walking away from the desk to do something else..UGH. Reminded me of some banks; just waiting to see if my clerk put out the \""back in 30 minutes\"" as I got to her window.\n\nGot checked in by a very friendly clerk; apologized vehemently about the long line and wait. Kudos to her. Got to the elevator (Towers 1 & 2), pushed for a ride to the 3rd floor. Waited.....waited.....pushed the button again....waited...waited....heard a \""CLUNK\"" and then up-up away, we went. Luckily I was the FIRST ONE off of the ride! \n\n** NOTE ** I haven't paid much attention to other elevators, but I DO know that this is the FIRST elevator I've been on that actually has a THIRTEENTH (13th) floor (button)!\n\nFigured I'd share that with you 'superstitious types;' you're welcome.\n\nNever realized how much of a HIKE it would be to get to my room! After what seemed to be my warm up for a 5K, I FINALLY got to my room, noticing there were another set of elevator doors less than 50 feet away from my room! After asking a housekeeping-type person, came to find out she DID NOT KNOW WHERE THE ELEVATORS WENT! I like adventure, but not that much, especially in a dark, damp, dank hotel (that I've seen so far).\n\nGot to my room, opened the door (NON SMOKING SIGN AFFIXED) and walked into an invisible cloud of musty cigarette smoke and an overpowering odor of what seemed to be a toilet that had not been flushed....FOR A WHILE.  Absolutely NOTHING will excite your olfactory nerves than urine-based ammonia with the musty smell of an old bowel movement. Trust me...I'm NOT exaggerating. Visions of the human litter box that had not been dumped, cleaned and returned to the corner came to mind.\n\nAfter cutting in line at the front desk (there was NO WAY IN HELL I was gonna wait another hour or longer to talk to someone about this), I was moved to another room. Not expecting anything other than a move, a few persons stated they were surprised I was not 'comped' for the inconvenience. Oh well...\n\nRoom two. Got there. Opened the door, and although the 'litter box had been dumped, cleaned and refilled (no odors) the musty smell of old cigarette smoke prevailed. Beds were comfortable 'enough, ' I guess. Pretty basic setup; only four (4) channels to watch (who watches tv in a hotel anyway, right)?\n\nI will admit, the room was cold. I like cold air much more than 'room-temperature' air, especially when sleeping. On the other hand, I (literally) held my breath after using the bathroom and flushing the toilet. Instead of the water going DOWN, it began RISING!!!! The water was spinning in the right direction, but coming UP! Just as the water started to touch the rim of the toilet bowl, it went down. I've noticed that each time I've flushed (maybe I should have used the litter box?).\n\nI had a medical conference to attend @ Ceasars Palace (across the street) and was gone all day. Out the door by 7am and back by 530, ready to collapse, take a nap and wander around later that evening.  Each and EVERY DAY I returned, my room had NOT been cleaned, nor the bed sheets changed or bed made!\n\nTried ...no no, I DID call the front desk. Guess what? THEY DO NOT ANSWER THE FREAKING PHONE!! I had to walk back to the desk to talk to them about this. They kindly informed me: The front desk phones at the Imperial Palace are NOT answered at the IP. They are answered by staff at THE FLAMINGO!\n\nMoving ahead a couple of days (I paid for a 6 day stay here for my conference); after returning to my room again, the SAME situation! I approached a Housekeeping-type-person who had pushed a cart into a laundry room and was placing towels on the cart. I asked the 'housekeeper' if he could clean my room when he surprised the HELL outta me! I will quote this housekeeper (said his name was \""Joey.\""\n\nHe smiled, looked down to his cart and looked back up to me saying \""Sir, I can't help you with that. Housekeeping here is outsourced. We've had problems with them ever since they started working here.\""\n\nGet this: I go BACK to the front desk, speak to a Hotel Front Desk Manager, share this information (with FOUR other hotel guests that came with me with the same problem). She informed us quickly \""Sir, we do not have anyone in Housekeeping named Joey.\""\n\nIf that wasn't bad enough, the restaurants all close by 9pm (not ONE advertisement states this)! Pretty dang bad when they have to refer you to ANOTHER HOTEL VENUE to eat at a restaurant!\n\nDO NOT STAY @ IMPERIAL PALACE!	0
This isn't a good nightclub. They don't take care of their customers. No access to water (fountains or water station), no ear plugs available (from bar, security, or bathroom concierge), don't honor drink tickets issued upon entry. The staff is indifferent, all for $50 of cover if you haven't called ahead. If clubs serve, they should be good hosts and at least help you sober up. Haze isn't one of them.	0
Just not very good. First off it's the only buffet in Vegas where I had to walk through a quarter mile long hallway through meeting and convention spaces to get to. Not sure why they wouldn't put this off the casino so people would actually know it's there and could find it easily.\n\nThe food was mediocre. It was all well seasoned but a lot of it tasted like it was using sub par ingredients and some like the spicy macaroni and cheese tasted processed. There is a very small selection of seafood as well so if you're the type to try and load up on shrimp and crab than you will be disappointed. The shrimp comes in containers with two small shrimp a piece and there was no crab. No prime rib either.\n\nThe service would have been good but we didn't get our drinks until after we had already finished eating. Overall I wouldn't recommend this buffet at all. I've had better ones at old dingy Vegas casino's. This is the Cosmopolitan, a five star joint. I still think the Buffet at the Wynn is the best in town.	0
The pizza crust was paper thin, and the pizza wasn't seasoned very well.  I thought the pricing was a bit high for the quality of food.  Definitely not a Grimaldi's quality pizza.  I doubt I'll come back.	0
There was a little bit of line.  Came here for frozen hot chocolate for $14.00, for small glass. Too sweet and overprice!  Didn't really like the looks of then food from other people's table.  Portion was huge and nothing really stands out.  I guess people who likes quantity than quality love to go there.  I think this place is overrated.  Thanks!	0
Never again.\n\nI brought my children here while we were visiting Montreal for American Thanksgiving.  The food was okay - my older child loved her chicken marsala, but the younger one was not thrilled with her fettucine alfredo, and my veal in mustard sauce was less than stellar.\n\nThe problem was the service.  The waiter kept speaking to my children in French, even though I had told him at the beginning of the meal that they don't speak the language.  After being gone from the city for 17 years, my French was passable, and I could understand what he said, but it's incredibly rude to address patrons continually in a language they don't understand, when you have been told as much and you speak their language.  It took nearly half an hour for the waiter to take our orders, another 45 minutes to get our food, and we never received the bruschetta we ordered as an appetizer.  And adding insult to injury, we were charged for my children's refills on soda.  The restaurant should absorb the cost of such things, considering it cost less than a quarter and they charged $2.50 per.  \n\nI would give this place zero stars if I could.	0
Meh.\n\nJust the branding of the name and located in Vegas Strip.\n\nI got gelato ice cream and it was overpriced. It was good, but a small scoop for nearly 6 bucks wasn't worth it to me. The flavor was not even an exotic one: Chocolate Hazelnut.\n\nIt's a cute store with a lot of things for display, but really alright for me.	0
I recently came here for a thermal wrap that I purchased from living social. It was unprofessional from the get-go. When I called  to make an appointment she kept me on the phone for ten minutes explaining how frustrated she was with living social and that the wrap won't do anything-- I needed to purchase a package for 8 sessions to see results. It just got worse when I got there. I arrived a few minutes early to my appointment and was unsure where to check in so I peaked my head into her suite where the appointment was and said, \""hello?\"". She didn't even say 'hi' she just said, \""Oh don't come in yet, I'm not ready\"" and hurriedly shut the door.\n\nWhen I was ready to come in she made me undress in front of her stating, \""It's ok I've seen lots of bodies, it's like I don't even see them anymore. I've even had whole families in here naked for spray tanning before. It's pretty cool.\"" (What??) I was not properly draped and felt uncomfortable. \n\nThe wrap consisted of being lightly swiped over with exfoliating gloves, then rubbed (barely touched) with the lotion. She then put a fleece blanket, heated blankets, and some thermal blanket that looked like a space blanket and let me 'bake' and put on Christmas music.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes she came back in and took off the blankets and put a cold pack on me to 'cool me off' (I was already freezing from the blankets coming off and this made me feel nauseous) She lifted up the little fleece blanket (the only thing covering me) and fanned me with it, making me feel exposed once again. The only good thing was the five minute massage she gave me at the end.\n\nDurring all of this  let her cell phone ring not once, not twice, but 5 separate times on loud and answering it as she walked out of the room (apparently she hasn't figured out how to put it on silent?) \n\nI purchased one as a gift for a friend as well and was refunded my money because I didn't want to subject anyone I know to that.  She claimed to be an expert at spray tanning, though. Maybe she should just stick to that.	0
Have always loved their smoothies. \nNever been much of a fan of the food....rather flavorless. \nThe staff is primarily incompetent and aloof.\nToday, they were rude to my daughter...and then to me.\nProbably a safe bet that we will not be returning.	0
The fish seemed fresh but the rice was undercooked or at the very least overly toothy. That's got to be a cardinal sin of some sort. Service was friendly, however and the atmosphere cozy.	0
I have gave this place two chances. First time ordered a Patty Melt, which was not on Rye bread and had American Cheese....INCORRECT! Second time I ordered Chiki Dogs, they were horrible, I couldn't even finish them.	0
The service is HORRIBLE. Food is okay.. My last choice if I want quick sushi. They always mess something up.	0
Ive eaten at your location since you arrived in the Concord area.   I will never eat there again.   Your mgr Matt,  hung out at the bar socializing never to check on the the guests on the floor.  When he finally decided to come to out table,  he no concern or care about our experience.   He continued like a robot giving us a book answer over and over and never let us speak.   Never had a problem with any other mgr or staff.   I will never return because of this mgr. They need to keep him in the back where he does not need to interact with the public.	0
Ok, time to bring these reviews down to reality.\n\nNote: I am not an Hawaiian food expert so if you are, take that into consideration.\n\nThis Resturant has Kitchen nightmare written all over it.  The Resturant itself is in TOTAL disrepair.  Lights and air conditioning don't work, the carpet is filthy, the tables are scattered with outdoor lawn chairs, cables hang from the ceiling, decor is beyond decayed.\n\nFOOD: based on reviews here, I had the Hawaiian plate.  The pork had over 1 pound of pure fat in it.   Maybe that's the Hawaiian way, but for me it looked totally disgusting.   My wife had the teriyaki bowl.  Parts of it were burnt and afterwards she was complaining her stomach hurt.  Rice was ok.\n\nDETAILS\nResturant:  1/10 (this ain't homey -- it's rundown)\nAmbiance:  1/10 (scary!)\nService: 5/10 (a little slow but friendly)\nCleanliness: 1/10 (board of health should be concerned.)\nFood: 1/10 (we were trying to determine what was editable. Not good.)\nRestroom: don't know.  I was too scared to go in.\nParking: 4/10 (small lot)\n\nOverall quality seemed to be totally lacking.	0
Stayed here for one night recently and it is nothing special. The men's room at the pool had a nauseating stench pouring out of it, the air conditioner in my room didn't work, it took over 40 minutes to check in, the customer service was really lacking, the pillows were the quality of a Motel 6. It is cheap and pretty centrally located, but I would rather spend a little more to have better amenities and services. Also was extremely bothered by the lack of security at the elevators. Won't be back.	0
Kinda overpriced and the food is very average. The orange was really good, it tasted like fresh squeeze.	0
Went back to Serendipity 3 and tried the Peanut Butter Frrrozen Hot Chocolate this time.  While it was good and tasted like a Reese's peanut butter cup, I still liked the regular double chocolate one much better.\n\nI was thinking that after a year, maybe things got better here with service.  Time wise, it actually got worse!  My friends and I were there, got our orders in about 10 mins, finished our food in 20 mins, but didn't actually leave the place till another hour later because our waitress disappeared on us.  Time is short when you're visiting Vegas, and we might have spent one hour too much over there.\n  \nSorry Serendipity 3, I have to downgrade you to 2 stars.  Step it up next time to get 5 stars!!!	0
Rather unimpressed. We got our fish tank and our first several waves of fish from here. The cookie cutter advice we received here led to the death of our fish over and over again. We finally went to a mom and pop aquarium shop where we got good advice and healthy fish, now they're thriving. \n\nAs far as service nearly every time we went in we had to go hunt someone down to help us. I mean you'd think someone would keep an eye out near the aquariums for folks who need help, I can't just grab my own fish from the tank.....	0
Totally a zero star place. I can't believe this kind of clinic exist. I just needed a quick physical exam and I couldn't make appointment anywhere else. I should've known better. They take walk ins. That just shows you this place isn't really what I think doctor office should be.\nVery shady looking. Makes you not wanna give them your information...\nAll paper work is printed out from crappy copy machine I can hardly read and some letters are cut off...\nSo far I've been waiting little over 1hour.\nReceptionist looks super busy, obviously short stuff. Taking 1hour to take my ID copied is a joke. Workers yelling at each other from back to front of the office... Very unprofessional. I guess this is exactly what you expect from this kind of place.\nPaper work everywhere on desk... Mess.\nI wish I read yelp review before I came down here.\nI haven't even seen a doctor yet but it doesn't matter anymore. I'll see her/him for 10min and I'm sure anyone can do exam just fine but overall experience at this point is like negative 3stars:(\n\nSeriously. Wait 2month to get an appointment with real doctor would be my best suggestion.	0
Nothing special at all.\nThe food is flavorless\ni came to eat here 3 different  times\n just thought maybe they had a bad day\nbut 3 strikes and im out.\n\nthis place is terrible\nit just seems like they are getting lazier and lazier \nfrom the flavorless food to the lousy service.\n\nhigh prices for cheap food and crappy service.	0
Even though I loved the location on Camden (now CLOSED) I really visited this store more!  Very impressed with the always friendly and helpful staff... Went to search the back for (never on display this season in this store) what I affectionately refer to as \""speedos\""  - when you say that word most everyone knows what you mean and if you know me, you know how serious I am about immodest swimwear (not too immodest though) square cuts and competition \""briefs\"" (old school 1980's).  No Jammers! - Forget those baggy-saggy ___ and board shorts are boring!  Back to the back (of the store) they look for me and found a box of \""speedos\"",  they looked good though only navy and black...  \n\nMore on American Apparel - Great service and I like the jeans a lot too, though not the new \""high-waisted\"" ones!	1
If you are a crazy U of I fan then you have to have the clothes to go with the attitude, yes?\n\nThis is not the cheapest place to get your orange and blue on but they do have quality merchandise and a bit different variety than you see at other bookstores.  (They also, curiously enough have books here!  For classes!  What?)\n\nThe Illini fan to whom I am married is 6'6\"" so it is hard to find Illini gear for him but they at least have an extended size rack here so he has managed to score a few items over the years.  They also have such cute baby clothes and as my eldest daughter is due in December, let's just say I may have gone a little crazy here last Saturday.\n\nIf you come here to buy your Illini wear, you might want to hit their special sales on Mom's Weekend, homecoming, stuff like that.  Now I didn't do that this last time but I have in the past.\n\nOskee Wow Wow, get your orange and blue here!	1
The experience with Dollheads was fantastic-had them come to our room to do my daughters hair and makeup and they (Cricelda and Mariana) were on-time, friendly and professional. They did an outstanding job! Will definitely be a returning customer. Oh, and whomever answers their phone is soooooo friendly, too-Rafael, I think is his name. A great experience from start to finish. They always kept in contact with me and were a breeze to work with....	1
Finally found my stylist! I just migrated from the Philippines and after 4 trial cut from different stylist I found Ken the great :) he got the cut the I wss looking for and I end up coloring my hair too! Love it love it love it!!!	1
\""Children and pet friendly while outlet shop\""\n\nDecent outlet. Selection not as good as Cabazon, but not bad either. Surprisingly very Dog friendly with plastic baggies and dog fountain. Very children friendly with water fountain and train rides.	1
[MY BACKGROUND]: I've been coming to Vegas since 1994, and tried pretty much every buffet on the Vegas strip. \n\n[DATE VISITED]: Saturday, March 16th, 2013, Dinner Buffet. Entered the line at 5:10PM, paid at 6:00PM, started eating at 6:40PM. \n\n[THE INTERIOR]: Before you enter the buffet, you will see a huge line, that will remind you of Disneyland. Once you enter the buffet, its major chaos..Chaos!! There are way too many people, and most of the tables seemed very close together. The noise level is really loud. I definitely will not bring my older relatives here, as they might find it too hectic. It seems like the people at Caesar's had a very obscure shaped room to fit in a buffet of this size. \n\n[THE FOOD]: Besides long lines, and chaotic atmosphere, the food here is really really good. The Asian section is probably one of the most authentic tasting Asian section at any Las Vegas buffet. This also goes for the rest of the buffet. The cocktail shrimps they serve are also one of the largest sized cocktail shrimp of any Vegas buffet I've tried.  My sister and I stood in line for the steamed crabs for at least 20 minutes. Determined that we were not going to wait in this line again, we practically filled mountain high 2 plates each (4 plates total), with a layer of cocktail shrimp, and a  huge pile of king crabs on top (we had 4 plates of these). Needless to say, we were a little carried away with how much we brought for my family of 4, but I think we pretty much were satisfied with how much shrimp and crab we ate, that it justified the $50 dinner cost. Also their dessert section is amazing. They also have different flavored mochi and gelato.\n\n[THE SERVICE]: Our server was amazing, in terms of getting our drinks, and cleaning our finished plates. No complaints at all here.  \n\n[THE GOOD]: \n- some of the best tasting buffet food hands down\n- the selection and variety is amazing, \n- the presentation of the foods in the small plates is very nice\n\n[THE BAD]\n- long Lines to get into the buffet, \n- more lines in the buffet to get the food\n- chaotic atmosphere\n- noise level is high, definitely not a place for a romantic dinner\n- One design flaw of the buffet is the line for the steamed crabs. The people that stood in line for the steamed crabs blocked off the whole seafood section. So for the people that did not want steamed crabs, but lets say want a piece of salmon in the seafood section, you couldn't because the people in line for the steamed crabs stood right in front of the food. I guess you could try to sneak in between people in the steamed crab line to get some food, but everybody in line for the steamed crabs had the \""I'm waiting in line, you should too\"" face.  This design flaw also applies to the meat carving section. The line for the meat carving section blocked off another section of the buffet, hence other people couldn't get to those foods either. At one point the line for the steamed crabs and meat carving section blended together, to form one mega line, that caused a lot of confusion. The issue is, they steam the crabs a little at a time, so the line went really really sloowwww. The line wasn't moving at multiple points. We waited at least 20 minutes to get the steamed crabs. They really should place a line divider for the people in these lines so they don't block half of the buffet. \n\n[OVERALL EXPERIENCE]: I've always wanted to try the Bacchanal buffet ever since it opened. We asked the waiter if its always like this, but they said its less crowded on the weekdays, and at earlier times. If I go again next time, I'm going to go at 3:30 PM, and try to avoid the 6 PM dinner crowd.	1
As a 2nd generation Italian, you know you're stepping in an authentic Italian caffe when it's 7:30 AM and 15 elderly Italians are sharing the place with you speaking to one another in different dialects of Italian with plenty of hand gestures to go around about \""La Seria A\"" (it was Monday).\n\nI ordered a cappuccino to go and was immediately received in a very friendly fashion despite on how busy it was. The quality of my cappuccino was exceptional and served quickly.\n\nThe price tag is a bit higher than some other places I know (with an extra fee of ordering to go?) but you'll pay for it and accept it. There's no denying the quality of this place and you pay more for quality.\n\nLa qualita e la.\n\nWill visit again.	1
Awesome.\n\nCirque de Soleil meets MXC\n\nPS: Cute Japanese girls in spandex doing acrobatics. If you are Master Roshi or white dude w/asian fetish, bring toilet paper. Because you will definitely nosebleed.	1
I like this exercise venue so much more than the place that used to collect my fat tax (a.k.a. membership fees). I'm slightly younger than average member, but I find that as a bonus inspiration. If the lady next to me can keep pace on the treadmill while sharing tales about the grandkids, I can power through the lingering remnants of those occasional college cigarettes and inactivity. The RMC is not open on Sundays, which supports my ideas of having a day off, or a cheat day. Good for classes, nice equipment and a rock climbing wall to boot. Can't beat it for the price.	1
This is a refeshingly cute little place in Edinburgh! It looks delicious from the outside, the bright red paint always glistens and looks really glossy - good enough to eat! And their displays are amazing!! At Halloween I spend about 20minutes looking at everything in their window, because there was so much to take in! It was closed at the time, otherwise I would have been in there in a shot. \nSo when I did go in I was amazed at what they had! Blast from the past or what, I was taking a trip down memory lane as I was browsing all the candy they have in here.\nThe staff are lovely too, really professional and they enjoy their job, you can tell. It makes all the difference!\nIt's relatively cheap too, compared to the other similar places.\nThe only thing I didn't like was the smell...it was sickly sweet and made me feel a bit queasy!	1
Great beer, nice atmosphere and a very informative staff.\n\nA brief chat with any of their staff will quickly inform you that this is a brewery were they brew German ales and lagers in a traditional German method, so there won't really be much 'experimenting' as some of the reviewers are complaining about. But what Mecklenburg does is make a very good beer in a city with almost no independent breweries.	1
Today is (or should I say, was) the first day of my \""no eating cupcakes\"" diet. \nHowever, the lure of \""salted caramel\"" cupcakes was too much to bear, and I ended up trying TopIt Cupcakes.\nThe storefront is really cute, and clean, and the people that work there are very nice!\nThere is a little area on the wall where you can \""top it\"" if you want to add to your cupcake toppings, as well ( I've never seen that before, but it's a great idea).\nNow, for the sugary details. \nI only ordered 2 cupcakes today (down from the normal 6, but I cannot continue to eat like this and fit in my skinny jeans!). Although I have never had a good peanut butter cupcake (usually too greasy) I ordered a peanut butter and jelly cupcake, and of course, salted caramel.\nBoth of the cupcakes were good in flavor, but the salted caramel could've used more sea salt (just a tad more, mind you). \nThe peanut butter and jelly (finally!) was my fave of the day. It was a white cupcake filled with grape jelly with peanut butter frosting (and, a little cookie on top). FINALLY, a cupcake store that got peanut butter right!\nHere's the negative on TopIt: Compared to Caketini (the best I've tasted so far) the cupcakes both were a little on the no-so-fresh-in-texture side. Not that the cupcakes were dry, but the tops were a little \""crusty\"". I know...picky,picky, picky...\nI get that they don't use preservatives, and I am happy for that, but just a tad more on the fresh side would've snagged me for life...or the life of my skinny jeans...\nAlso, these cupcakes are \""normal\"" size, which I personally like better than the biggies at some of the other cupcake stores...\nStill, this place has a lot to offer in the cupcake world, and I'll definitely be back on Fridays for Cotton Candy, Malted Milk Ball and whatever I can stuff in my ever-growing tummy.	1
Vraiment de tr\u00e8s bons Sushi!!! Les pizzas Sushi sont un d\u00e9lice!! \u00c7a ne se compare vraiment pas aux autres cha\u00eenes de restaurant a de Sushi!! Livraison rapide!! Et bon prix !!	1
Hugo was great, He has been there for 11 years and he knows how to cut hair, old school.  I felt he did a great job at all the classic details right down to the hot lather shave of the back of my neck and sideburns for a really crisp edge.  He made sure my brows were not bushy and that no stray hairs were growing out of my ears.  I have not had such a professional and enjoyable haircut in years and wanted to share the experience. While I was there a steady flow of people came in, The other Barber while I didn't catch his name seemed equally professional.  This is a Barbershop the old fashion way, a place for all kind of guys to get the haircut they are looking for	1
So happy we don't have to drive to Anstruther to get great fish and chips any more! light flaky batter - chips that are crispy on the outside and soft inside - my perfect Fish and Chips. I've taken away and sat in the restaurant - both great. \n\nIf you go for take away - be prepared to wait.  they fry the fish and chips to order - nothing is sitting around!!	1
Decent tasting. Super cheap for the strip. Super duper cheap compared to the other offerings in the same food court. Not super authentic, but what do you expect from a Chinese take-out place in the middle of Las Vegas?	1
good sandwiches. the gread is always soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. haven't tried anything else here though. they have pho and other stuff.	1
Just paid another visit to this brewery and I have to say it was a good one they have improved greatly in a few months (maybe trying to live up to their award for best new brewery) \n\nThe first time i visited the beers were just ok, too hoppy and kind of generic for my taste and the only good one was the Sour Wheat beer (unique, refreshing and very light alcohol). I liked the chill kinda vibe and the outdoor theme. Gotta love the bearded brewers :-)\n\nThis round i tried the coffee stout, the Sour wheat (called BWBW i believe) and  Dark ale. Seems they always have 6 on tap the others were IPA style so not for me. The coffee stout is one of the best i have ever had, so smooth and creamy and great flavor, it does have coffee in it so i should only try these earlier in the day :-). The others we very tasty as well and have now changed my opinion on this place (before it was barely a 3 star).\n\nI tried the rosemary fries cooked in duck fat and they were yummy, still need to go back and try the food.\n\nIt was busy around happy hour but manageable (early in the week anyways) and our server was good and knowledgeable.	1
Tried this place out after I saw they won the Arizona taco festival in a number of categories. After trying it myself I certainly can tell why. Their tacos have super thin tortillas that provides a flavor explosion in your mouth. The carne asada is different than a traditional carne taco but it has to be one of my favorite menu items. Everything I have tried has been good. The atmosphere is great too. I am pleasantly surprised this place is still on local dines, it's a great deal.	1
I have been here plenty of times and the food is always great and service is spot on! They will accommodate special requests with no problem!\nI love the Tom Yum soup, and they were kind enough to make it vegetarian and add noodles!\nAlso the green curry and red curry are favorites, along with the coconut mango sticky rice for dessert!	1
I just had the best interview with Ms Townsend.  Not only was she kind, she was just brilliant in the analysis of my employment issue. Even though I was calling for a friend, and from out of state, she took the time to direct me (and my friend) to another attorney who could best serve our needs.	1
Following recommendations I made a reservation and was glad I did.  Business was brisk on a Thursday night.    I arrived at 5:40 for a 6:00 o'clock reservation, and found a parking spot right in front of the door.  This was a sign that it was going to be a good night.  It was half price Sake night - a carafe of Fuji Apple Sake was a great starter while I awaited my friends.  We were seated promptly when everyone arrived.  Our waiter was very knowledgable and helpful explaining the extensive menu.  One guest and I decided to split the Caribbean Summer Rolls, and I am glad we did, otherwise I would not have been able to eat my dinner.  I chose Filet Oscar Roll from the Burgushi menu, while another diner chose the South of the Border Roll, the third party in our group went for the Moriawase dozen and was glad she followed the waiters recommendation to start off with the dozen and if she wanted more he could increase it to the double deuce.   Everyone enjoyed the food.  Desserts were ordered to go.   My apple pie wontons were alright, but probably would have been better if I weren't so full and could have eaten them there while they were warm.  A nice touch was the owner coming around to ask us about our dining experience and to hand out cards for a free appetizer which are good until the end of 2011.   I like the burgushi concept.  Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar is definitely on my list of favorites and places I would go on a date or take an out of town guest.	1
The pizza here is really good !! I always go with friends cause its an awesome place. The only thing I think its wrong is the establishment charging for Ranch... But besides that I super recommend this place its good and not too pricy.	1
I've been on Duck tours in Boston, Philly, DC, and Seattle - but the Pittsburgh Just Ducky Tour was by far the best!  Colton was our guide and was very good. The tour goes through downtown and through a beautiful section of the river. This is a must do if you visit Pittsburgh.	1
I have to come to understand and accept that I am probably the reason restaurateurs  hate yelpers.\n\nI just have no appreciation for atmosphere. I know this because during my 12-day stay in the Bay area, the word had to be repeatedly hammered into my brain, as the natives could not understand how I could merely judge a restaurant's merit based solely on their cuisine. \n\nEventually they wrote me off as a lost cause, chalking up my dis-appreciation of fine decor and tacky acoustic music as a symptom of being Phoenician. \n\nFor a while I was confused. I didn't know what was wrong with me. Was I just impossible to please? Had I no taste for aesthetics? Oh shit, I have no aesthetic sensibility. I'm an art major. What does that mean for me?\n\nAll I have is a clock radio. Who am I Mommy?\n\nI was beginning to have some serious doubts about my aptitude for critique. \n\nSweet Zombie Jesus. Maybe I didn't know what I was talking about all this time.\n\nAfter all, Angie and Jimmie's is as far from atmosphere as you could be. Like, as far as John Cage is from actual music, or Miley Cyrus from being talented. \n\nFun Fact: While in San Carlos we saw a guy parked underneath a Miley Cyrus billboard giving himself some of the old \""self-service at the pump\"". True story.\n\nThere are no polished tables and cushy chairs at A&J's. No, instead they have those all-plastic all-purpose chairs that last you years and years sitting in your backyard until you invite that one plus-sized friend of yours who sits in it and bends it in such a way that is is never usable again. \n\nAnd there is no ambient music. Only the sounds of the arcade machines and the TV, which no matter what time of day is always playing a crime drama. Or a Billy Mays infomercial.\n\n \""HI BILLY MAYS HERE BUY SOME FUCKING OXI-CLEAN OR I'LL SHOVE SOME MIGHTY PUTTY UP YOUR ASS WHILE I BANG YOUR WIFE!\""\n\nThe staff at A&J care as much about presentation as Fred Phelps does about receiving a box set of \""The L Word\"" for Christmas.\n\nTheir wings are not soaked in the sauce (BBW calls the process \""spinning\"") like at other joints. No, the wings are cooked, and then, the sauce is poured over them. At first you're like \""this is fucking shady, I am not pleased with this\"", but when you can actually taste the chicken, and dont' have to ask for like fifty extra napkins, you find you might actually walk away from the table with some dignity. \n\nTry saying the same thing after paying 9 bucks for half a sandwich while ten pounds of bitch in a five pound bag asks you if you have room for dessert.\n\nThe subs are meaty and quite sustaining. So I've heard. I have a rule about ordering shit that isn't on the sign. I've never ordered a cheeseburger at Del Taco or chicken nuggets at a Red Lobster, and here I am, still alive and kicking. The system works.\n\nThe pizza is simply fucking fabulous. It's crispy but never crunchy, hot but never molten, and cheesy but never \""hey, how long are you going to be on the toilet? I need to take a shower\"" cheesy. Honestly, the only pizza I've had in Phoenix that even compares to it is Pizza A Metro...which is another small independently owned pizza shop crammed next to a Circle K...\n\n...\n\nMaybe it isn't me. Maybe it's just Phoenix. Or just the west side of it. Everything's backwards here. It's like Bizarro world.\n\nAll the best food is located in these hole-in-the-walls, where the decor is haphazard the menus have to be laminated because people are always spilling shit on them. \n\nThere's still a pretty good chance that I'm a tasteless Philistine, but we're  in Bizarro World and that makes me a learned connoisseur of wealth and taste. \n\nI fucking love it here.	1
I had a fantastic time at the Trump Hotel with my Girlfriend Lily. We started by having breakfast with my family, going to F21 (the largest one ever), throwing on our new dresses, buying nail polish at the spa, hanging out by the pool, then making lasagna in my room.\n\nI enjoyed staying at the Trump. The room is beautiful and located across from the giant Fashion Show Mall, all valet hotel, the service was a little slow. I think they were a bit understaffed, with that said, the staff was always friendly. We had an issue with the movie channels and engineering came up and fixed it right away. Housekeeping was also on hand with I was cooking the lasagnas. We did have to call them three times to come up, again, I think that is a staffing issue.\n\nTip: Since this is an all valet hotel call valet prior to going downstairs so that they can bring your car up. Also, strip facing views are amazing... we stayed in Penthouse 6000. It is not a casino so keep that in mind if you plan on booking and I didn't think the restaurant there was that great either. So, I guess what I am saying is I loved the view, the location, and the gorgeous room with full kitchen for my lasagna making...pictures on my blog	1
I use to eat here up to 3 times a week when I first head of this place. It's close enough that it delivers to my job and in the same plaza as my hair salon so it was a must every time I was nearby. A little overpriced for the kind of food that it is but it sooo delicious.\n\nmy favorites are the fried crab rice, the yellow curry, their eggrolls, and their Thai tea.\n\nvery quick delivery	1
I rarely write reviews on yelp but after my fourth visit to Southwest Bimmers, I had to show some love. By far the best place to bring your BMW in the Las Vegas area. Extremely easy to make an appointment, very knowledgable staff, and they give you options which most places don't do. Most shops I have been to will just say this is what you need done and that's that. Southwest Bimmer will give you a couple options and works with you to get the lowest price. I wouldn't say they are the cheapest in town, but I would rather pay a couple extra bucks to get the better service. Plus if you have a bimmer you should be able to afford better service. It is far cheaper than going to a BMW dealership and they have just as good if not better technicians. \n100% recommend them.	1
Perfect spot on the strip!\n\nJust to reiterate what's already been said.....\n\n*YES, it's a timeshare; therefore don't expect daily room service (just call when you need a cleaning)\n*YES; there's no casino; BUT you're connected to the Cosmo and a 5min walk to Bellagio\n\nBONUS it's like a mini apartment, you can save and re-heat your leftover food. Chill your drinks and all that other good stuff you do at home except smoke, there is absolutely NO SMOKING, they will charge you!	1
This location has the best staff, they're friendly and inviting. I come here often and they remember my order which is a huge plus. Dutchbros espresso is awesome, it'll really wake you up, unlike starbucks.\n\nAnother big plus is when the drive thru line is packed someone will come out and take your order so by the time you get to the window your drink is ready!	1
Really nice guy, great communication- and very important to me- he does what he says he's going to do!	1
My family hosted the First Annual Eddie Martinez Cinco de Mayo at the River Bottom Grill on 5/4/13 and it was awesome!!! River Bottom went above and beyond to help make this a successful fundraising event! The food and drinks were great and the space was perfect for the event.  There was a bounce house and water slide for the kids along with facepainting, sno cones, silent auction, cake auction, etc.  It was amazing to see the town of Florence come together to support my cousin's husband, Eddie in his battle against cancer.  My husband and I will definitely be back and look forward to next year's event!	1
