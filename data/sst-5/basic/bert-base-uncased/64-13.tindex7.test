[SEP]confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it . A terrible piece. [SEP]a film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations . A okay piece. [SEP]the soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot . A bad piece. [SEP]impossible as it may sound , this film 's heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition . A great piece. [SEP]but here 's the real damn : it is n't funny , either . A [MASK] piece.	0
