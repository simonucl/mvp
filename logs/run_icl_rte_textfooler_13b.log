/mnt/data/mvp/src/utils/funcs.py:261: FutureWarning: load_metric is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version of datasets. Use 'evaluate.load' instead, from the new library 🤗 Evaluate: https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate
  metric = load_metric('accuracy')
The model was loaded with use_flash_attention_2=True, which is deprecated and may be removed in a future release. Please use `attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"` instead.
You are attempting to use Flash Attention 2.0 with a model not initialized on GPU. Make sure to move the model to GPU after initializing it on CPU with `model.to('cuda')`.
