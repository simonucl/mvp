You can inspect the repository content at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/datasets/2.18.0/metrics/accuracy/accuracy.py
You can avoid this message in future by passing the argument `trust_remote_code=True`.
Passing `trust_remote_code=True` will be mandatory to load this metric from the next major release of `datasets`.

The model was loaded with use_flash_attention_2=True, which is deprecated and may be removed in a future release. Please use `attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"` instead.
You are attempting to use Flash Attention 2.0 with a model not initialized on GPU. Make sure to move the model to GPU after initializing it on CPU with `model.to('cuda')`.
