The caller reported to police that the accused, a family member, stabbed the family’s dog, a 10-month old shepherd lab mix, multiple times before leaving the area on foot. The accused was located a short time later by responding officers and detained without incident. The dog was transported to a local animal hospital with serious injuries.
