the more advanced amatuer<SPLIT>[[[[Label_2]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_3]]]]: even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under

positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_9]]]]: 4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance ' s stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )<SPLIT>[[[[Label_9]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_10]]]]: the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots<SPLIT>[[[[Label_10]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_11]]]]: the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective<SPLIT>[[[[Label_11]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_12]]]]: when the overall image quality ( especially natural colours , details , natural looking of the pictures ) is the most important thing , then this camera its top notch and very impressive<SPLIT>[[[[Label_12]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_13]]]]: but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity an exceptional close up shooting capability<SPLIT>[[[[Label_13]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_14]]]]: 8 perhaps inspired by the canon ' s factory white correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets<SPLIT>[[[[Label_14]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_15]]]]: best camera ever from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything<SPLIT>[[[[Label_15]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_16]]]]: you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight camera shake is a problem to contend with<SPLIT>[[[[Label_16]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_17]]]]: this is the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to<SPLIT>[[[[Label_17]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_18]]]]: its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ' ve seen<SPLIT>[[[[Label_18]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_19]]]]: overall it is the best camera on the market<SPLIT>[[[[Label_19]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_20]]]]: the disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures , especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can<SPLIT>[[[[Label_20]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_21]]]]: the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4 times optical zooms gets you just that much closer<SPLIT>[[[[Label_21]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_22]]]]: i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera , but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size<SPLIT>[[[[Label_22]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_23]]]]: the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds<SPLIT>[[[[Label_23]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_24]]]]: other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better<SPLIT>[[[[Label_24]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_25]]]]: the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc<SPLIT>[[[[Label_25]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_26]]]]: the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there<SPLIT>[[[[Label_26]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_27]]]]: but this camera is great !<SPLIT>[[[[Label_27]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_28]]]]: i ' d give it 5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes<SPLIT>[[[[Label_28]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_29]]]]: now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !<SPLIT>[[[[Label_29]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_30]]]]: otherwise , it takes very good pictures shutter delay is n ' t so bad either<SPLIT>[[[[Label_30]]]]:

6610<SPLIT>[[[[Label_13]]]]: [[positive]]<SPLIT>[[[[Example_14]]]]: the 6600 ( t mobile ) is the true ' world phone ' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe , including new zealand and australia ( 900 ) whereas the 6620 ( available from singular ) replaces it w 800mhz ( some refer to as 850 )<SPLIT>[[[[Label_14]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_15]]]]: after years with that carrier '

dream to operate in auto mode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes<SPLIT>[[[[Label_6]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_7]]]]: it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual<SPLIT>[[[[Label_7]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_8]]]]: however , this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes<SPLIT>[[[[Label_8]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_9]]]]: ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have n ' t even gotten to all of them yet<SPLIT>[[[[Label_9]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_10]]]]: 1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n ' t want to bother with the settings<SPLIT>[[[[Label_10]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_11]]]]: a great camera , but here are some points which i don ' t notice in most of the reviews here , which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer<SPLIT>[[[[Label_11]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_12]]]]: i ' d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like<SPLIT>[[[[Label_12]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_13]]]]: the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them<SPLIT>[[[[Label_13]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_14]]]]: i discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure , white balance , flash ( red eye , person against bright background , flash on , flash off , flash automatic )<SPLIT>[[[[Label_14]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_15]]]]: the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use<SPLIT>[[[[Label_15]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_16]]]]: the manual mode is feature rich and i can ' t wait to get the hang of it<SPLIT>[[[[Label_16]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_17]]]]: the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful scene mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach snow , sunset etc , are endless<SPLIT>[[[[Label_17]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_18]]]]: by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stop action photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced<SPLIT>[[[[Label_18]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_19]]]]: i love having the option to manually control the f stop , shutter speed and even focus<SPLIT>[[[[Label_19]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_20]]]]: the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it there are tons of features i have n ' t even gotten to<SPLIT>[[[[Label_20]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_21]]]]: with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality<SPLIT>[[[[Label_21]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_22]]]]: i haven ' t tried to set up any advanced features on the router , but it is not difficult to set up for basic use<SPLIT>[[[[Label_22]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_23]]]]: i wo n ' t go into the details here , as the online sites ( steve ' s digicams , previews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers<SPLIT>[[[[Label_23]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_24]]]]: i found best results in most situation with manual center auto focus , manual mode , iso 100 ( shorter aperture time , so more often sharper images as with iso 50 ) , auto white balance ( auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras i have and they already do very well )<SPLIT>[[[[Label_24]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_25]]]]: but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in auto mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !<SPLIT>[[[[Label_25]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_26]]]]: i ' ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too<SPLIT>[[[[Label_26]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_27]]]]: i think the os and controls are very well thought out and although i ' ll admit i was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the micro , the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so<SPLIT>[[[[Label_27]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_28]]]]: in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results<SPLIT>[[[[Label_28]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_29]]]]: you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus<SPLIT>[[[[Label_29]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_30]]]]: very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera<SPLIT>[[[[Label_30]]]]: [[negative]]<SPLIT>[[[[Example_31]]]]: also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls<SPLIT>[[[[Label_31]]]]: [[positive]]",0.02595740556716919,0.07585817575454712,1,1,1,32,"Failed"

experience<SPLIT>[[[[Label_11]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_12]]]]: the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can ' t get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n ' t know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight )<SPLIT>[[[[Label_12]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_13]]]]: ) worst feature possible , this alone makes it rate one star what ' s up with no recharge cord ?<SPLIT>[[[[Label_13]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_14]]]]: anted to

support<SPLIT>[[[[Label_17]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_18]]]]: i ' m giving it 1 star because as compared to other nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies ( such a

!<SPLIT>[[[[Label_4]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_5]]]]: pc software that comes with the player is not as simple as i tunes but its not bad at all<SPLIT>[[[[Label_5]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_6]]]]: 2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information<SPLIT>[[[[Label_6]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_7]]]]: it ' s perfect for those who aren ' t planning on storing tons of music<SPLIT>[[[[Label_7]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_8]]]]: as for itunes , i don ' t find it to be as good as the windows media player as a computer mp3 player , but it is good enough<SPLIT>[[[[Label_8]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_9]]]]: i do n ' t always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags<SPLIT>[[[[Label_9]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_10]]]]: while the software may not be as easy as i tunes , it is not difficult to use by any stretch<SPLIT>[[[[Label_10]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_11]]]]: but for now it appears that this player does n ' t play well with itunes<SPLIT>[[[[Label_11]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_12]]]]: i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes ( no music i want , but thats just me ) and the creative product was cheaper and i needed to be able to use wma files<SPLIT>[[[[Label_12]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_13]]]]: if there were any complaints i have , they are marginal , but one is apples ' proprietary set up for music files , their incompatibility with other music services ( i e napster ) is down right wrong<SPLIT>[[[[Label_13]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_14]]]]: the cons are n ' t really a big deal to me except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files no folder structure and it ' s based on the title of the songs many of my songs where separated into folders ( on the pc ) and a few had same titles so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n ' t have any that might be the same as another<SPLIT>[[[[Label_14]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_15]]]]: they are extremely convent and you don ' t have to buy them seperately has i tunes , which provides quality music at low prices<SPLIT>[[[[Label_15]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_16]]]]: finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best<SPLIT>[[[[Label_16]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_17]]]]: also , the wma compression format is superior to mp3 , especially at lower bit rates , so i needed a player that could handle wma and integrate well with my windows xp computers<SPLIT>[[[[Label_17]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_18]]]]: other mp3 players won ' t give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this compression level , so i imagine they won ' t at lower ones , either<SPLIT>[[[[Label_18]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_19]]]]: the songs do n ' t play one after another like on a cd<SPLIT>[[[[Label_19]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_20]]]]: i got it to use with the new 5 per month service from yahoo ( music unlimited , ) and despite the above issues , i love it<SPLIT>[[[[Label_20]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_21]]]]: only slight negatives i ' ve had so far is that i haven ' t been able to get it to accept any of my wav files yet<SPLIT>[[[[Label_21]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_22]]]]: the only downside i see is that it does n ' t look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer<SPLIT>[[[[Label_22]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_23]]]]: there is also no voice recording , something most if not all mp3 players have that the ipod doesn ' t<SPLIT>[[[[Label_23]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_24]]]]: the sound is bright and clear , the ability to store any mp3 ' s ( and not just apple approved files ) is great , and i plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time<SPLIT>[[[[Label_24]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_25]]]]: 3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software<SPLIT>[[[[Label_25]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_26]]]]: 3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players<SPLIT>[[[[Label_26]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_27]]]]: audio formats supports both mp3 , wma and yeah , wav too<SPLIT>[[[[Label_27]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_28]]]]: i have no problem using itunes with the zen micro ( in a makeshift sorta way )<SPLIT>[[[[Label_28]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_29]]]]: i dont especially like how music files are unstructured basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization , like you might have in windows explorer folders and sub folders<SPLIT>[[[[Label_29]]]]: [[positive]]<SPLIT>[[[[Example_30]]]]: i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n ' t a big problem<SPLIT>[[[[Label_30]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_31]]]]: 3 ) folders can not be created
