numbingly simple to use<SPLIT>[[[[Label_1]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_2]]]]: what a kick butt mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source , instead of paying for them two or three times , then get the creative zen ipod killer , kiss my ass itunes !<SPLIT>[[[[Label_2]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_3]]]]: the zen serves as a back up device as well as a player<SPLIT>[[[[Label_3]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_4]]]]: the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you ' re driving at night ) , and there ' s no way to change

really a big deal to me except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files no folder structure and it ' s based on the title of the songs many of my songs where separated into folders ( on the pc ) and a few had same titles so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n ' t have any that might be the same as another<SPLIT>[[[[Label_10]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_11]]]]: so

positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_12]]]]: i think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good<SPLIT>[[[[Label_12]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_13]]]]: the ipod comes formatted for the mac , but within seconds of plugging it into a pc , is automatically reformatted for windows ( the hp version comes with windows formatting , and takes seconds to change to mac ) although the
