interface replaceable , powerful battery good software wake up , sleep timers multiple play modes<SPLIT>[[[[Label_5]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_6]]]]: but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad<SPLIT>[[[[Label_6]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_7]]]]: i have n ' t had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs<SPLIT>[[[[Label_7]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_8]]]]: price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad<SPLIT>[[[[Label_8]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_9]]]]: other plusses changeable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod<SPLIT>[[[[Label_9]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_10]]]]: battery life is about 1 4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive<SPLIT>[[[[Label_10]]]]: [[positive]]<SPLIT>[[[[Example_11]]]]: my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature<SPLIT>[[[[Label_11]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_12]]]]: what is added in functionality ( battery

positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_14]]]]: our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price<SPLIT>[[[[Label_14]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_15]]]]: zennx ' s replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod<SPLIT>[[[[Label_15]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_16]]]]: the voice recorder is a beautiful add on not even necessary , but just an example of why apple just wants your money and creative labs wants to make a better player<SPLIT>[[[[Label_16]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_17]]]]: also , i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software , which i had with audigy zs sound card originally it is definitely an added plus<SPLIT>[[[[Label_17]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_18]]]]: also , the battery ' s aren ' t user replaceable<SPLIT>[[[[Label_18]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_19]]]]: pros huge storage capacity

battery life and lower price i found both<SPLIT>[[[[Label_20]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_21]]]]: the only downside i see is that it does n ' t look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer<SPLIT>[[[[Label_21]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_22]]]]: also the battery life isn ' t great but it ' s sufficient for my needs<SPLIT>[[[[Label_22]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_23]]]]: 1 ) great sound ( 98db signal to noise ratio beats ipod ' s unspecified ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head phones as well as external speakers<SPLIT>[[[[Label_23]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_24]]]]: another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load wav sounds as ringers<SPLIT>[[[[Label_24]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_25]]]]: 2 ) nice features , like web browser , camera , video recorder , speaker phone ( very usefully ) , clear voice reception<SPLIT>[[[[Label_25]]]]:

and software ( 25 )<SPLIT>[[[[Label_2]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_3]]]]: before you run out and buy an ipod , understand something there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle , principally excellent ( for mp3 ) sound quality<SPLIT>[[[[Label_3]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_4]]]]: the zen plays mp3 , wma and wave formats , which makes it more versatile than the ipod<SPLIT>[[[[Label_4]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_5]]]]: the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n ' t as easy as the ipod ' s , or as sexy looking<SPLIT>[[[[Label_5]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_6]]]]: 1 ) great sound ( 98db signal to noise ratio beats ipod ' s unspecified ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large

and are willing to deal with the possibility ( not the certainty ) of setup gremlins , by all means get the zen micro<SPLIT>[[[[Label_7]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_8]]]]: however , the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the ' zen micro ' has to offer<SPLIT>[[[[Label_8]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_9]]]]: creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack<SPLIT>[[[[Label_9]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_10]]]]: the zen was an impressive purchase and i would highly recommend it to anyone using napster<SPLIT>[[[[Label_10]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_11]]]]: i compared it to other cd players ( two models of panasonic , rio samsung ) and they were no way even near zen micro<SPLIT>[[[[Label_11]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_12]]]]: overall , it does its basic function very well , but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the zen micro does not rise to the occasion<SPLIT>[[[[Label_12]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_13]]]]: if your looking for a great sounding mini player , you can ' t go wrong with the zen micro<SPLIT>[[[[Label_13]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_14]]]]: about the product the zen micro is a sleek , stylish device that caters not just to hip youngsters but to people of all

alternative<SPLIT>[[[[Label_22]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_23]]]]: while i ' m not too keen on their customer service ( none of the products i have from creative have given me issues ) , i can definitely recommend the zen micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth<SPLIT>[[[[Label_23]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_24]]]]: the sound is great , the portability , etc all the stuff you expect from a good mp 3 player , this zen micro has it<SPLIT>[[[[Label_24]]]]:

is where i love zen the most<SPLIT>[[[[Label_26]]]]: [[positive]]<SPLIT>[[[[Example_27]]]]: given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software<SPLIT>[[[[Label_27]]]]: [[positive]]<SPLIT>[[[[Example_28]]]]: if i was pressed to find a negative aspect of the zen micro i would probably have to mention weak fm reception , but the building where i primarily use the micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway , so you can take that for what it ' s worth<SPLIT>[[[[Label_28]]]]:

' t be happier and i ' m convinced it ' s the best one out there<SPLIT>[[[[Label_29]]]]: [[positive]]<SPLIT>[[[[Example_30]]]]: other mp3 players won ' t give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this

the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features<SPLIT>[[[[Label_1]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_2]]]]: deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd party earphones ( 20 ) and software ( 25 )<SPLIT>[[[[Label_2]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_3]]]]: before you run out and buy an ipod , understand something there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle , principally excellent ( for mp3 ) sound quality<SPLIT>[[[[Label_3]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_4]]]]: the zen plays mp3 , wma and wave formats , which makes it more versatile than the ipod<SPLIT>[[[[Label_4]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_5]]]]: the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n ' t as easy as the ipod ' s , or as sexy looking<SPLIT>[[[[Label_5]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_6]]]]: 1 ) great sound ( 98db signal to noise ratio beats ipod ' s unspecified ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head phones as well as external speakers<SPLIT>[[[[Label_6]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_7]]]]: bottom line if you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services , and are willing to deal with the possibility ( not the certainty ) of setup gremlins , by all means get the zen micro<SPLIT>[[[[Label_7]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_8]]]]: however , the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the ' zen micro ' has to offer<SPLIT>[[[[Label_8]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_9]]]]: creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack<SPLIT>[[[[Label_9]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_10]]]]: the zen was an impressive purchase and i would highly recommend it to anyone using napster<SPLIT>[[[[Label_10]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_11]]]]: i compared it to other cd players ( two models of panasonic , rio samsung ) and they were no way even near zen micro<SPLIT>[[[[Label_11]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_12]]]]: overall , it does its basic function very well , but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the zen micro does not rise to the occasion<SPLIT>[[[[Label_12]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_13]]]]: if your looking for a great sounding mini player , you can ' t go wrong with the zen micro<SPLIT>[[[[Label_13]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_14]]]]: about the product the zen micro is a sleek , stylish device that caters not just to hip youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life , size , or the awkward factor<SPLIT>[[[[Label_14]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_15]]]]: the main issue now is that this new zen micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily<SPLIT>[[[[Label_15]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_16]]]]: i think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good<SPLIT>[[[[Label_16]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_17]]]]: the creative zen micro , at first glance , is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers<SPLIT>[[[[Label_17]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_18]]]]: zennx ' s replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod<SPLIT>[[[[Label_18]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_19]]]]: by far this seems to be the best value out there for the money if you are undecided , the creative zen micro seems to be the best choice<SPLIT>[[[[Label_19]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_20]]]]: feature for feature , i find it a very sweet little player equipped with a higher end headphone system , between this and th larger zen hardly use my home stereo system anymore<SPLIT>[[[[Label_20]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_21]]]]: the zen micro is near perfect<SPLIT>[[[[Label_21]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_22]]]]: the zen offered a great alternative<SPLIT>[[[[Label_22]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_23]]]]: while i ' m not too keen on their customer service ( none of the products i have from creative have given me issues ) , i can definitely recommend the zen micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth<SPLIT>[[[[Label_23]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_24]]]]: the sound is great , the portability , etc all the stuff you expect from a good mp 3 player , this zen micro has it<SPLIT>[[[[Label_24]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_25]]]]: however after playing with it for three weeks now , i ' m convinced , the zen micro is superior<SPLIT>[[[[Label_25]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_26]]]]: sound this is where i love zen the most<SPLIT>[[[[Label_26]]]]: [[negative]]<SPLIT>[[[[Example_27]]]]: given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software<SPLIT>[[[[Label_27]]]]: [[negative]]<SPLIT>[[[[Example_28]]]]: if i was pressed to find a negative aspect of the zen micro i would probably have to mention weak fm reception , but the building where i primarily use the micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway , so you can take that for what it ' s worth<SPLIT>[[[[Label_28]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_29]]]]: before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n ' t be happier and i ' m convinced it ' s the best one out there<SPLIT>[[[[Label_29]]]]: [[negative]]<SPLIT>[[[[Example_30]]]]: other mp3 players won ' t give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this compression level , so i imagine they won ' t at lower ones , either<SPLIT>[[[[Label_30]]]]: [[negative]]<SPLIT>[[[[Example_31]]]]: and so far , i have been very , very happy with my zen

control over exposure , white balance , flash ( red eye , person against bright background , flash on , flash off , flash automatic )<SPLIT>[[[[Label_3]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_4]]]]: the manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance ( but there is no manual focus or manual exposure )<SPLIT>[[[[Label_4]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_5]]]]: it seems to me that

very well )<SPLIT>[[[[Label_28]]]]: [[positive]]<SPLIT>[[[[Example_29]]]]: 2 ) the delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some

screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus<SPLIT>[[[[Label_31]]]]: [[positive]]","[[[[Sentence]]]]: i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority , aperture priority , light metering adjustments , etc , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear<SPLIT>[[[[Example_0]]]]: if you on the other hand always use automatic settings ( and not manual ) you should be just fine , as the camera features some of the best automatic settings i have ever seen<SPLIT>[[[[Label_0]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_1]]]]: i love having the option to manually control the f stop , shutter speed and even focus<SPLIT>[[[[Label_1]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_2]]]]: with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality<SPLIT>[[[[Label_2]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_3]]]]: i discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure , white balance , flash ( red eye , person against bright background , flash on , flash off , flash automatic )<SPLIT>[[[[Label_3]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_4]]]]: the manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance ( but there is no manual focus or manual exposure )<SPLIT>[[[[Label_4]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_5]]]]: it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?<SPLIT>[[[[Label_5]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_6]]]]: also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls<SPLIT>[[[[Label_6]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_7]]]]: but if you ' ve used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !<SPLIT>[[[[Label_7]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_8]]]]: the camera is a dream to operate in auto mode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes<SPLIT>[[[[Label_8]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_9]]]]: however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 of the shots that i take<SPLIT>[[[[Label_9]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_10]]]]: the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them<SPLIT>[[[[Label_10]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_11]]]]: the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful scene mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach snow , sunset etc , are endless<SPLIT>[[[[Label_11]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_12]]]]: the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use<SPLIT>[[[[Label_12]]]]: [[negative]]<SPLIT>[[[[Example_13]]]]: the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting<SPLIT>[[[[Label_13]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_14]]]]: i ' d give it 5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes<SPLIT>[[[[Label_14]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_15]]]]: with the automatic settings , i really have n ' t taken a bad picture yet<SPLIT>[[[[Label_15]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_16]]]]: for example , in auto mode you can ' t use the flash redeye reduction , you must be in manual mode for that<SPLIT>[[[[Label_16]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_17]]]]: the last problem i found with this camera was the macro function<SPLIT>[[[[Label_17]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_18]]]]: when you learn how to change some settings , you can make the quality even better<SPLIT>[[[[Label_18]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_19]]]]: 1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n ' t want to bother with the settings<SPLIT>[[[[Label_19]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_20]]]]: settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints<SPLIT>[[[[Label_20]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_21]]]]: if you ' ll only read the whole manual , you ' ll find out even more cool features and you ' ll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading<SPLIT>[[[[Label_21]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_22]]]]: exposure compensation in 1 3 stop increments ( i leave it set on 1 3 stop to brighten up the default exposure , which goes a bit dark for my taste )<SPLIT>[[[[Label_22]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_23]]]]: i ' ve taken about hundred shot with the canon , in varying lighting situations , all in auto mode , and not one blurry picture ! ! !<SPLIT>[[[[Label_23]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_24]]]]: even when i set it to low , it ' s still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what i want it to do<SPLIT>[[[[Label_24]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_25]]]]: the light auto correction is awesome<SPLIT>[[[[Label_25]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_26]]]]: the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative<SPLIT>[[[[Label_26]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_27]]]]: another problem i had with this camera was the zoom function<SPLIT>[[[[Label_27]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_28]]]]: i found best results in most situation with manual center auto focus , manual mode , iso 100 ( shorter aperture time , so more often sharper images as with iso 50 ) , auto white balance ( auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras i have and they already do very well )<SPLIT>[[[[Label_28]]]]: [[negative]]<SPLIT>[[[[Example_29]]]]: 2 ) the delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots<SPLIT>[[[[Label_29]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_30]]]]: i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n ' t take weeks to figure out how to operate<SPLIT>[[[[Label_30]]]]: [[negative]]<SPLIT>[[[[Example_31]]]]: you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on

bother , this is a much better buy<SPLIT>[[[[Label_23]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_24]]]]: apple still does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini<SPLIT>[[[[Label_24]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_25]]]]: other than the fact that one can ' t delete a file directly from the ipod , the interface is excellent and mind numbingly simple to use<SPLIT>[[[[Label_25]]]]:

choice than an ipod<SPLIT>[[[[Label_27]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_28]]]]: ease of use design the ipod is a very easy to use mp3 player , and if you can ' t figure this out , you shouldn ' t even

micro<SPLIT>[[[[Label_0]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_1]]]]: the zen does n ' t support folders so it is not really a storage device even with third party software that creates folders , documents

to the menu<SPLIT>[[[[Label_6]]]]: [[positive]]<SPLIT>[[[[Example_7]]]]: seemed like a good deal , but this pps frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then

up<SPLIT>[[[[Label_13]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_14]]]]: the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie extras on them on the two

takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture<SPLIT>[[[[Label_21]]]]:

bit odd , sometimes i get 9 secs on my recordings , sometimes i get 17<SPLIT>[[[[Label_23]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_24]]]]: i ' ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great<SPLIT>[[[[Label_24]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_25]]]]: transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2 0<SPLIT>[[[[Label_25]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_26]]]]: file transfers are fast ,

for<SPLIT>[[[[Label_11]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_12]]]]: i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer<SPLIT>[[[[Label_12]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_13]]]]: it is a bit cumbersome , and i can ' t get to the songs i want as quickly<SPLIT>[[[[Label_13]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_14]]]]: the cons are n ' t really a big deal to me except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files no folder structure and it ' s based on the title of the songs many of my songs where separated into folders ( on the pc ) and a few had same titles so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n ' t have any that might be the same as another<SPLIT>[[[[Label_14]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_15]]]]: has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousands of songs and organizes them great<SPLIT>[[[[Label_15]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_16]]]]: navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well<SPLIT>[[[[Label_16]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_17]]]]: i dont especially like how music files are unstructured basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization , like you might have in windows explorer folders and sub folders<SPLIT>[[[[Label_17]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_18]]]]: if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs<SPLIT>[[[[Label_18]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_19]]]]: finding all the albums , songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig ( well 18 gig ) worth of music<SPLIT>[[[[Label_19]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_20]]]]: the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen<SPLIT>[[[[Label_20]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_21]]]]: the only downside i see is that it does n ' t look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer<SPLIT>[[[[Label_21]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_22]]]]: track , name , artist , album and genre is automatically retrieved via internet labeled , and properly categorized into the zen<SPLIT>[[[[Label_22]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_23]]]]: i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough<SPLIT>[[[[Label_23]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_24]]]]: navigation could be better , but there is n ' t really anything the zen xtra can ' t do once you ' ve gotten comfortable with it<SPLIT>[[[[Label_24]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_25]]]]: i love that you can create custom playlists , and organize music in so many different ways<SPLIT>[[[[Label_25]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_26]]]]: first , the cons a tad bulky not the most aesthetic looking player and does n ' t support a folder structure<SPLIT>[[[[Label_26]]]]:

supposed to do and more without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth<SPLIT>[[[[Label_9]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_10]]]]: the zen micro is no exception in addition to the case , it

camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots<SPLIT>[[[[Label_30]]]]: [[positive]]<SPLIT>[[[[Example_31]]]]: i also tend to like
