buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use<SPLIT>[[[[Label_20]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_21]]]]: i also tend to like the sliding cover on switch found on many compact ps cameras since it ' s much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot<SPLIT>[[[[Label_21]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_22]]]]: this is the perfect camera for a

positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_1]]]]: sound this is where i love zen the most<SPLIT>[[[[Label_1]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_2]]]]: some features that the ' zen micro ' has that sold me on my purchase include a 5g hard drive actually an sd flash card drive very large and much more than actually needed , the ability to sync with microsoft outlook ' s calendar , the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours ( i can change the battery myself for about 40 to buy vs<SPLIT>[[[[Label_2]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_3]]]]: the zen lives up to the audio quality i love and

zen<SPLIT>[[[[Label_8]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_9]]]]: creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack<SPLIT>[[[[Label_9]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_10]]]]: after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed<SPLIT>[[[[Label_10]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_11]]]]: since zen does not have an external antenna it has some problems catching weak signals but it

there<SPLIT>[[[[Label_20]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_21]]]]: if you want to purchase a real case or container or clip on carrier for you zen micro , expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time<SPLIT>[[[[Label_21]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_22]]]]: at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra ' s combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria<SPLIT>[[[[Label_22]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_23]]]]: all in all , creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features , and i look forward to the nomad zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype<SPLIT>[[[[Label_23]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_24]]]]: the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what

positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_3]]]]: the movie mode is also working great<SPLIT>[[[[Label_3]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_4]]]]: great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc<SPLIT>[[[[Label_4]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_5]]]]: the auto focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject<SPLIT>[[[[Label_5]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_6]]]]: i discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure , white balance , flash ( red eye , person against bright background , flash on , flash off , flash automatic )<SPLIT>[[[[Label_6]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_7]]]]: the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective<SPLIT>[[[[Label_7]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_8]]]]: another problem i had with this camera was the zoom function<SPLIT>[[[[Label_8]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_9]]]]: the functionality on this camera is mind blowing<SPLIT>[[[[Label_9]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_10]]]]: the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use<SPLIT>[[[[Label_10]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_11]]]]: i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it<SPLIT>[[[[Label_11]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_12]]]]: i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession great for action shots<SPLIT>[[[[Label_12]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_13]]]]: for example , in auto mode you can ' t use the flash redeye reduction , you must be in manual mode for that<SPLIT>[[[[Label_13]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_14]]]]: it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light<SPLIT>[[[[Label_14]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_15]]]]: but if you ' ve used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !<SPLIT>[[[[Label_15]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_16]]]]: it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot<SPLIT>[[[[Label_16]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_17]]]]: i ' ve taken about hundred shot with the canon , in varying lighting situations , all in auto mode , and not one blurry picture ! ! !<SPLIT>[[[[Label_17]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_18]]]]: just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has<SPLIT>[[[[Label_18]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_19]]]]: with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality<SPLIT>[[[[Label_19]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_20]]]]: this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has<SPLIT>[[[[Label_20]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_21]]]]: also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls<SPLIT>[[[[Label_21]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_22]]]]: i also did n ' t like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode<SPLIT>[[[[Label_22]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_23]]]]: maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing<SPLIT>[[[[Label_23]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_24]]]]: i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode<SPLIT>[[[[Label_24]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_25]]]]: one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low<SPLIT>[[[[Label_25]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_26]]]]: the disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures , especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can<SPLIT>[[[[Label_26]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_27]]]]: the digital zoom is crap<SPLIT>[[[[Label_27]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_28]]]]: this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well<SPLIT>[[[[Label_28]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_29]]]]: i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture<SPLIT>[[[[Label_29]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_30]]]]: i tell you now , after lot of shooting in many different situations , this camera is amazing<SPLIT>[[[[Label_30]]]]:

larger zen hardly use my home stereo system anymore<SPLIT>[[[[Label_12]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_13]]]]: other mp3 players won ' t give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this compression level , so i imagine they won ' t at lower ones , either<SPLIT>[[[[Label_13]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_14]]]]: since zen does not have an external antenna it has some problems catching weak signals but it works<SPLIT>[[[[Label_14]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_15]]]]: at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra ' s combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria<SPLIT>[[[[Label_15]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_16]]]]: transferring music is a breeze i don ' t subscribe to music services , but as mentioned on other reviews , micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes<SPLIT>[[[[Label_16]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_17]]]]: finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best<SPLIT>[[[[Label_17]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_18]]]]: with accessories , you can make the ipod into a digital recorder , broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology , and play it through your car speakers using either a cd adaptor or fm stereo broadcaster<SPLIT>[[[[Label_18]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_19]]]]: this one is particularly bothersome allegedly one can use the zen micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another<SPLIT>[[[[Label_19]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_20]]]]: sound this is where i love zen the most<SPLIT>[[[[Label_20]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_21]]]]: i had a casio unit , which had given great service , and would have been happy to get another one , but was tempted by the ipod ' s sleek design , storage capacity , connection options firewire and usb , and its integration with itunes<SPLIT>[[[[Label_21]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_22]]]]: ease of use design the ipod is a very easy to use mp3 player , and if you can ' t figure this out , you shouldn ' t even own one<SPLIT>[[[[Label_22]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_23]]]]: if your looking for a great sounding mini player , you can ' t go wrong with the zen micro<SPLIT>[[[[Label_23]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_24]]]]: well , i have an ipod mini and i really like it , but all in all , i like the zen micro more<SPLIT>[[[[Label_24]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_25]]]]: creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack<SPLIT>[[[[Label_25]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_26]]]]: this is my first mp3 player and i am so impressed with what such a small device can do<SPLIT>[[[[Label_26]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_27]]]]: try before you buy if at all possible although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface<SPLIT>[[[[Label_27]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_28]]]]: 10 ) multiple play modes tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter<SPLIT>[[[[Label_28]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_29]]]]: it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error<SPLIT>[[[[Label_29]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_30]]]]: the zen offered a great alternative<SPLIT>[[[[Label_30]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_31]]]]: to use the creative zen player with a subscription service , you need to go to creative ' s web site , and download new software for your pc<SPLIT>[[[[Label_31]]]]: negative",0.02931225299835205,0.02931225299835205,1,1,1,1,"Failed"

real powerhouse<SPLIT>[[[[Label_0]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_1]]]]: i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3<SPLIT>[[[[Label_1]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_2]]]]: the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots<SPLIT>[[[[Label_2]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_3]]]]: the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few

the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use<SPLIT>[[[[Label_8]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_9]]]]: although canon ' s batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon<SPLIT>[[[[Label_9]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_10]]]]: i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period !<SPLIT>[[[[Label_10]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_11]]]]: 2 battery life is over 4 5 hours , compared to about 2 5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for

better pictures in my opinion with the battery life you ' ve got<SPLIT>[[[[Label_23]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_24]]]]: and bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as i thought it would , i usually can go 1 5 days with bluetooth on along with making calls before i need a full recharge<SPLIT>[[[[Label_24]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_25]]]]: maybe it is my lack of experience , but i

think most people would ever need and , for the price , i highly recommend it<SPLIT>[[[[Example_0]]]]: finally , compare the ipod to other players on a cost gb , and also consider ease of use<SPLIT>[[[[Label_0]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_1]]]]: unless you have an enormous music audio book library , the 20 gb model should have more than adequate storage capacity , with a stated

negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_9]]]]: the ipod is a very nice product , which given reasonable care , should give a lot of service<SPLIT>[[[[Label_9]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_10]]]]: the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent<SPLIT>[[[[Label_10]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_11]]]]: further , the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the ipod<SPLIT>[[[[Label_11]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_12]]]]: right out of the box , i loved it , better features than the ipod , great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources i can use<SPLIT>[[[[Label_12]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_13]]]]: durability not good first

buy<SPLIT>[[[[Label_17]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_18]]]]: also if you want a device that does so much more than the ipod mini but is at the same price , this is the player for you<SPLIT>[[[[Label_18]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_19]]]]: if anyone is thinking of getting an ipod mini , forget it and go with this player<SPLIT>[[[[Label_19]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_20]]]]: to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod<SPLIT>[[[[Label_20]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_21]]]]: i had a casio unit , which had given great service , and would have been happy to get another one , but was tempted by the ipod ' s sleek design , storage capacity , connection options firewire and usb , and its integration with itunes<SPLIT>[[[[Label_21]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_22]]]]: ease of use design the ipod is a very easy to use mp3 player , and if you can ' t figure this out , you shouldn ' t

Having begun with medical sales four years prior, La Mota hit the ground running when it came time for recreational weed, and with 11 locations across the state—including two on Portland's eastside—La Mota's selection is consistently exceptional and its facilities are as clean as its logo. You might fork over a little extra cash for the quality, but if you're purchasing less than an ounce, why not treat yourself? Make sure to at least take a whiff of the Banana Cream OG or pick up a couple grams of Sour Tahoe for $40. If you check out the Northeast 99th Avenue location, use Northeast Wygant Street or park at the Shell station on Sandy Boulevard, as it's located on a confusing little cul-de-sac.<SPLIT><SPLIT>[[[[Label_27]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_28]]]]: Bagels & Bluegrass Bicycle Century Tour presents donation to JSCC<SPLIT><SPLIT>[[[[Label_28]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_29]]]]: if you are looking for a user friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained , than the diaper champ is the one for you !<SPLIT>[[[[Label_29]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_30]]]]: to eliminate any smells we simple stuck a stick up room deodorizer inside the lid<SPLIT>[[[[Label_30]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_31]]]]: Join us on Wednesday October 11 for our October Business Mixer.

positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_13]]]]: the zen lives up to the audio quality i love and expect<SPLIT>[[[[Label_13]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_14]]]]: on the downside , i think the interface takes some getting used to and the zen software !<SPLIT>[[[[Label_14]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_15]]]]: however after playing with it for three weeks now , i ' m convinced , the zen micro is superior<SPLIT>[[[[Label_15]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_16]]]]: i ' ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times<SPLIT>[[[[Label_16]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_17]]]]: the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n ' t as easy as the ipod ' s , or as sexy looking<SPLIT>[[[[Label_17]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_18]]]]: creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack<SPLIT>[[[[Label_18]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_19]]]]: some features that the ' zen micro ' has that sold me on my purchase include a 5g hard drive actually an sd flash card drive very large and much more than actually needed , the ability to sync with microsoft outlook ' s calendar , the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours ( i can change the battery myself for about 40 to buy vs<SPLIT>[[[[Label_19]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_20]]]]: 10 ) multiple play modes tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter<SPLIT>[[[[Label_20]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_21]]]]: better for the zen micro is outlook compatibility<SPLIT>[[[[Label_21]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_22]]]]: the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen<SPLIT>[[[[Label_22]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_23]]]]: 1 creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds 3 , 400 tracks 12 5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?<SPLIT>[[[[Label_23]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_24]]]]: the zen micro is no exception in addition to the case , it comes with a neck strap , and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging<SPLIT>[[[[Label_24]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_25]]]]: feature for feature , i find it a very sweet little player equipped with a higher end headphone system , between this and th larger zen hardly use my home stereo system anymore<SPLIT>[[[[Label_25]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_26]]]]: battery life is about 1 4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive<SPLIT>[[[[Label_26]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_27]]]]: other mp3 players won ' t give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this compression level , so i imagine they won ' t at lower ones , either<SPLIT>[[[[Label_27]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_28]]]]: zennx ' s replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod<SPLIT>[[[[Label_28]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_29]]]]: to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player<SPLIT>[[[[Label_29]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_30]]]]: there is no fm tuner , while there is no fm tuner on the creative zen ( on the micro version of the zen there is a tuner ) , the iriver h10 20gb , the rio karma , and the audio x5 have fm tuners<SPLIT>[[[[Label_30]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_31]]]]: after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative ,

digital zoom is crap<SPLIT>[[[[Label_0]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_1]]]]: the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one

digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight camera shake is a problem to contend with<SPLIT>[[[[Label_8]]]]: negative<SPLIT>[[[[Example_9]]]]: the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry<SPLIT>[[[[Label_9]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_10]]]]: i also did n ' t like the way it

that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had simone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image appeared on the decently sized screen<SPLIT>[[[[Label_18]]]]: positive<SPLIT>[[[[Example_19]]]]: its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a
