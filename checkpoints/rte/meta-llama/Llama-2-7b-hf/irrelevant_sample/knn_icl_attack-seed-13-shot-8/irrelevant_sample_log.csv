The ship was originally part of an armada led by Vasco de Gama, but sank in a storm in 1503. One of the artifacts, a bronze disc measuring around seven inches in diameter, was recently confirmed to be a rare astrolabe, a type of navigational instrument. When the object was first brought to the surface it was unclear what it might be, since all lines and nautical markings had disappeared. Only two symbols remained visible—the Portuguese coat of arms and the personal emblem of King Dom Manuel I. However, 3-D laser scanning undertaken by the University of Warwick revealed 18 etched lines radiating from the disc’s center, each separated by five-degree increments. Sailors used these markings to measure the sun’s height above the horizon at noon, which helped them determine their location.<SPLIT><SPLIT>Hypothesis_10: natasha kaplinsky and justin bower  got married three years ago.<SPLIT>Label_10: true<SPLIT>Premise_11: a series of projects with the objective of finding solutions to some of the consequences of the chernobyl accident have been carried out within the framework of the unesco chernobyl programme. the ihp organized a workshop to review and compare present knowledge of radionuclide transfer in the hydrological cycle.<SPLIT>Hypothesis_11: the chernobyl disaster had repercussions outside the ex-ussr.<SPLIT>Label_11: false<SPLIT>Premise_12: Other than the final result, Donato's NHL debut could not have gone any better.

Led by Hersch on piano, an eight-piece ensemble evokes sweeping melodicism, while vocalists Kurt Elling and Kate McGarry present Whitman’s words with grace, emotion, and lyrical sweetness. It has been over 160 years since Whitman wrote his epic masterwork, ""Song of Myself,"" the centerpiece of Hersch’s ""Leaves of Grass,"" and its messages seemed almost alien to society at the time. Now, its promotion of unapologetic love for one’s true self, appreciation of the present, wonder at the miracle of nature, and the openhearted love of all beings is especially timely and important.

"[[[[Premise]]]]: a new study conducted by researchers from university of otago's christchurch school of medicine has found that certain chemical compounds naturally found in cruciferous vegetables help kill cancer cells that are particularly resistant to chemotherapy. the study has been published in cancer research. the research team found that chemicals called isothiocyanates cause cancer cells to commit suicide. this includes cells with high levels of the protein bcl-2, which makes them resistant to chemotherapy. isothiocyanates are naturally found in cruciferous vegetables. these include kale, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, bok choy, radish, and watercress, among others.<SPLIT>[[[[Hypothesis]]]]: broccoli contains isothiocyanates.<SPLIT>[[[[Premise_0]]]]: [[the]] [[pentagon]] [[is]] [[rejecting]] [[demands]] [[by]] [[kyrgyzstan]] [[to]] [[pay]] [[for]] [[the]] [[past]] [[use]] [[of]] [[manas]] [[air]] [[base]], [[a]] [[key]] [[military]] [[facility]] [[for]] [[us]] [[aircraft]] [[flying]] [[missions]] [[to]] [[afghanistan]].<SPLIT>[[[[Hypothesis_0]]]]: [[manas]] [[air]] [[base]] [[is]] [[located]] [[in]] [[kyrgyzstan]].<SPLIT>[[[[Label_0]]]]: [[true]]<SPLIT>[[[[Premise_1]]]]: [[ahern]], [[who]] [[was]] [[travelling]] [[to]] [[tokyo]] [[for]] [[an]] [[eu-japan]] [[summit]] [[yesterday]], [[will]] [[consult]] [[with]] [[other]] [[eu]] [[leaders]] [[by]] [[telephone]] [[later]] [[this]] [[week]] [[in]] [[an]] [[effort]] [[to]] [[find]] [[an]] [[agreed]] [[candidate]] [[to]] [[presidency]] [[of]] [[the]] [[european]] [[commission]].<SPLIT>[[[[Hypothesis_1]]]]: [[eu]] [[leaders]] [[found]] [[an]] [[agreement]] [[about]] [[a]] [[candidate]] [[to]] [[the]] [[post]] [[of]] [[european]] [[commission]] [[president]].<SPLIT>[[[[Label_1]]]]: [[false]]<SPLIT>[[[[Premise_2]]]]: [[the]] [[united]] [[iraqi]] [[alliance]], [[endorsed]] [[by]] [[iraq's]] [[top]] [[shiite]] [[clerics]], [[captured]] [[more]] [[than]] [[two-thirds]] [[of]] [[the]] [[3]].3 [[million]] [[votes]] [[counted]] [[so]] [[far]], [[the]] [[election]] [[commission]] [[said]].<SPLIT>[[[[Hypothesis_2]]]]: [[the]] [[united]] [[iraqi]] [[alliance]] [[won]] [[more]] [[than]] [[two-thirds]] [[of]] [[the]] [[3]].3 [[million]] [[votes]] [[counted]] [[so]] [[far]], [[the]] [[election]] [[commission]] [[said]].<SPLIT>[[[[Label_2]]]]: [[true]]<SPLIT>[[[[Premise_3]]]]: [[the]] [[osaka]] [[world]] [[trade]] [[center]] [[is]] [[the]] [[tallest]] [[building]] [[in]] [[western]] [[japan]].<SPLIT>[[[[Hypothesis_3]]]]: [[the]] [[osaka]] [[world]] [[trade]] [[center]] [[is]] [[the]] [[tallest]] [[building]] [[in]] [[japan]].<SPLIT>[[[[Label_3]]]]: [[false]]<SPLIT>[[[[Premise_4]]]]: [[argentina]] [[was]] [[still]] [[obsessed]] [[with]] [[the]] [[falkland]] [[islands]] [[even]] [[in]] [[1994]], [[12]] [[years]] [[after]] [[its]] [[defeat]] [[in]] [[the]] [[74-day]] [[war]] [[with]] [[britain]].<SPLIT>[[[[Hypothesis_4]]]]: [[the]] [[falklands]] [[war]] [[took]] [[place]] [[in]] [[1982]].<SPLIT>[[[[Label_4]]]]: [[true]]<SPLIT>[[[[Premise_5]]]]: [[journalists]] [[of]] [[the]] [[concealed]] [[bbc]], [[that]] [[was]] [[made]] [[happen]] [[through]] [[advisers]] [[of]] [[london]] [[industralists]], [[asked]] [[slavkov]].<SPLIT>[[[[Hypothesis_5]]]]: [[bbc]] [[undercover]] [[reporters]], [[posing]] [[as]] [[consultants]] [[acting]] [[for]] [[london]] [[businessmen]], [[ask]] [[slavkov]].<SPLIT>[[[[Label_5]]]]: [[false]]<SPLIT>[[[[Premise_6]]]]: [[the]] [[revamped]] [[engine]] [[indexes]] [[more]] [[pages]] [[than]] [[before]], [[can]] [[give]] [[direct]] [[answers]] [[to]] [[factual]] [[questions]], [[and]] [[features]] [[tools]] [[to]] [[help]] [[people]] [[create]] [[detailed]] [[queries]].<SPLIT>[[[[Hypothesis_6]]]]: [[the]] [[engine]] [[can]] [[answer]] [[specific]] [[queries]] [[directly]].<SPLIT>[[[[Label_6]]]]: [[true]]<SPLIT>[[[[Premise_7]]]]: [[most]] [[of]] [[the]] [[mines]] [[are]] [[in]] [[arid]] [[areas]] [[and]] [[animals]] [[searching]] [[for]] [[water]] [[are]] [[attracted]] [[to]] [[the]] [[cyanide-laced]] [[holding]] [[ponds]] [[that]] [[are]] [[an]] [[integral]] [[part]] [[of]] [[the]] [[mining]] [[operations]].<SPLIT>[[[[Hypothesis_7]]]]: [[animals]] [[have]] [[died]] [[by]] [[the]] [[thousands]] [[from]] [[drinking]] [[at]] [[cyanide-laced]] [[holding]] [[ponds]].<SPLIT>[[[[Label_7]]]]: [[false]]<SPLIT>[[[[Premise_8]]]]: [[the]] [[borrowers]] [[must]] [[form]] [[five-member]] [[groups]] [[that]], [[along]] [[with]] [[the]] [[bank's]] [[field]] [[workers]], [[closely]] [[supervise]] [[the]] [[loans]].
